"It looks like trouble.",
"Hmm.. Yes it does, Mr. Sharpe.",
"Where did you spring from, Lieutenant? And who are you... Sir?",
"A tunnel, no time to explain. I'm Lieutenant Horatio Hornblower of the 'Indefatigable'. Who are you soldier, and what are you doing here?",
"Sharpe, Second Battalion Sir. Rifleman, the 33rd Foot... I'm in command of a detachment to guard the spring and it looks like we'll being seeing some action pretty soon.",
"Detachment? Where are your men? And your Officers?",
"No Officers sir. Sergeant Wilkins is in command but he has returned to town for the moment. There are two behind you sir. The rest are in the valley behind me. More than enough to wipe out these Frenchies, when they get here. They certainly do row slowly.",
"What are you talking about man? I see no-one.",
"That's all to the good then, sir. Because if you could see them, then so could the Frenchies, and then their ship would open up on us, and that wouldn't be pleasant, now would it?", 
"Sorry Sharpe, you're right of course. We came to stop the French too. But now you've given me a better idea.",
"I can't think of a much better idea than defeating Frenchmen.. sir. And my orders are to protect the water supply.",
"I think my idea will satisfy us both Sharpe.",
"I'm listening, Lieutenant?",
"If you would let the French crew through into the valley. Then just capture them, no firing.",
"And the point of that, Lieutenant?",
"It will give Mr. Hunter here, time to go back to town and get the crew back here. We dress up as the Frenchmen, sail out and take the ship as well.",
"A canny idea, lieutenant. I like it.",
"Off you go Hunter. As fast as you can, and no noise when you get back to the beach.",
"They are coming. Are you ready?", 
"Yes! Let's go.",
"Was that quiet enough for you, Lieutenant? Not a shot fired.", 
"They are unarmed! But Thank you anyway Sharpe, that was quiet enough. Can you hold them here till your relief arrives?",
"Yes sir. Sergeant Wilkins should be back soon.",
"Good. I must go and see about capturing a ship.",
"He had no knife. When Harper and I got back here, we decided to try a little trading with our friends here. We found they were selling government stores, so we disarmed them and were having a chat, when you burst in.",
"As I said it was all too fast for me to see.",
"We need to keep this one alive Captain. Your other Lieutenant was a little quick in 'protecting' me for my liking. Higgins, when 'chummy' here wakes up, take him to the prison and guard him yourself.",
"...",
"Lieutenant, these are drawings of British ships, and if I'm not mistaken this one's of the 'Indy'. Now what would that be doing here?",
"You're right Sharpe. And we need to confirm that this is the pirate encampment, and if we can, why they would be interested in the 'Indy'.",
"That means going through the door over there. After you, Lieutenant.",
"Ah! Yes I suppose it does.",
"Lieutenant, we have two options now as I see it. We can go and find the entrance to the Academy, or go back to the Smuggler's House. What are your orders, sir?",
"I think we should look for the Academy entrance, that will give us the complete picture of how the tunnels connect. Then we can report back on all we have seen. Let's go.",
"We need to regroup in the valley. Follow me, Lieutenant.",
"I'm right behind you Sharpe.",
"A successful mission, lieutenant. Between us we captured a whole ship's company and the ship itself. We are to report to the Naval Academy. Forthwith, was the word used I believe.", 
"That's their polite way of their saying at once. We'll be getting our next orders there.",
"I'm hoping I get transferred back to Europe. I need to get back into the real war.",
"We shall see very soon sergeant. Let's get off to the Academy shall we.",
"I think we should get back to the Smuggler's House and report that we have seen the French here. Let's go.",
"This is it, Lieutenant. This is the storeroom under the Academy.",
"So there is indeed a link from the Smuggler's House, the Pirate Camp and the Academy. We need to get back and report, although I'm not looking forward to going through those tunnels again.",
"No need sir, We can go upstairs into the Academy and go back to the house across town. Follow me.",
"That's part of the puzzle done. We need to go back now and find the pirate camp entrance.",
"Lieutenant, I think we have seen more than enough for now. What are your orders, sir?",
"We must get back to the Smuggler's House and Captain Pellew to make our report. Let's go.",
"I heard all that, Lieutenant, and although it's not my place to speak on the matter, I appreciate what you are doing for the troops.",
"You are correct Sharpe. It is not your place to speak.... But, thank you anyway. I just hope I'm doing the right thing.",
"Bye the bye. I looked over the dead. There's no sign of your Lieutenant Quelp being here.",
"I don't know what to make of him. Friend or foe? Anyway, we need to get to the ship, those drums are getting nearer. We will meet the 'Indy' once we are out to sea.",
"What rope bridge is this?",
"It's in the next bay. It leads to the fort, we were imprisoned there once, but there are two guards each end of the bridge.",
"Let's go look at it then. Four guards don't seem that they would present much of a problem.",
"Very well. Let's take a look. There are two ways up to the bridge. We need to take the one where the guards have the least chance of seeing us. Follow me.",
"Ah! I see them. They think we are still on the other beach, I'm thinking. This shouldn't be too difficult.... Haggman, Tongue, quietly now.",
"They have a cannon on the far side. That wasn't there before. What do you intend to do?",
"Simple, Haggman and Tongue shoot the two on the far side to prevent them from firing the cannon. Then take care of the two on this side. Let's get out of their way.",
"O.K. Sharpe, I'm ready.",
"Hold on, Lieutenant. It would be better if Haggman, Tongue and I went up first. You should follow us.",
"We have the bridge.... Rifles! Secure the position, get over the other side and guard that cannon, in case anyone comes out of the fort. Lieutenant, bring up the rest of the crew.",
"Aye aye, Sharpe.... Archie! Matthews! Bring up the crew man, quickly now!",
"The Colonel is dead and it looks like the ship is ours.",
"LOOK OUT SHARPE!",
"What the....",
"He was trying to kill you. Lieutenant Quelp saved your life, Sharpe.",
"Much obliged, Mr. Quelp. Much obliged.",
"What's the situation Mr. Quelp? Do you know?",
"I just don't know what to make of that man, Lieutenant.",
"You're remembering the incident with Larr in #sCharlestown# I assume.",
"Yes.... Then, we thought he was working for the French, and then he turns up in a Spanish prison, and then he saves my life.",
"It's hard to doubt a man who has saved your life, perhaps twice, Sharpe.",
"Maybe.... How did he come to be in that prison again?",
"He said the French exchanged him for one of their officers the Spanish were holding.",
"Hmmm.... And what did the Spanish Colonel say?",
"Er... nothing actually, he wasn't there at the time Mr. Quelp spoke to me. The Colonel just said he was a prisoner.",
"I need to think about this further and try to get things straight in my mind.",
"And I need to see to the burial party on shore. Post guards on all decks, Sharpe. We will be back as soon as we can.",
"This is going to be a pleasant adventure for me.",
"What do you mean?",
"I need to get the situation with Lieutenant Quelp sorted out. He is my main suspect. That man just doesn't sit well with me.",
"But he saved your life!",
"Perhaps. Perhaps I am wrong about him, but if I can talk to him directly then I will find out what I need to know. He's not in town now, so we need to find him, but I don't know where he went.",
"You may not know where he is, but I know who does... Lieutenant Chadd! A moment if you please.",
"That was easy enough. #sisland_Cayman# it is. I will collect my men and then we can set sail.",
"Who was that?",
"Who was who?",
"That midshipman that just ran out of the room.",
"I don't know. Probably someone who slipped off his ship for a quick drink, and didn't want to get caught being in the tavern when he shouldn't be.",
"He looked like he knew one of us at least, and I think I've seen him before somewhere.",
"Well, he wasn't a lieutenant, and it's a lieutenant we are looking for.",
"I'm not sure. It didn't seem right.",
"Well there are no officers in here. Let's go back outside.",
"If we hurry we can make the next high tide.",
"It won't take us long to be ready. We travel light.",
"Sharpe... Sergeant... Second Battalion, 95th Rifles. Sir.",
"Well, well, well. Promoted to sergeant Eh! Sharpe?",
"Not only that, Lieutenant, but we have been formed into our own Rifle detachment because of our accuracy.",
"Yes I noticed how good you were with those muskets.",
"We don't use muskets. We use rifles. My men are all crack shots, we call them Chosen Men. They never miss.",
"I stand corrected Sergeant.",
"I believe sir, we are to continue serving together on the 'Renown'.",
"You are to join her too?",
"Yes sir. We are about to board her now.",
"Then we will meet again Sergeant Sharpe. I shall look forward to it.",
"Damit! They've seen us! Get ready to fight lads!",
"They have a cannon over there and it's pointing this way.",
"That wasn't there last time I was here.",
"They may only be able to get us with a lucky shot, using muskets, but we can start picking the gunners off with our rifles sir.",
"Good idea Sharpe.",
"Right then.... Patrick, you and Tongue go over the hillock at the back there and see what you can do. I will follow with the rest of the men shortly.",
"Where ever the French are, they have certainly got our boys bottled up in this area.",
"You're right Sharpe. Look there's Matthews over there. Let's get a report from him on the situation.",
"Watch how you go over there. The French have cannon remember.",
"I know Sergeant. Let's get to Matthews.",
"Midshipman? ... I told you I saw a midshipman on #sisland_Cayman#.",
"Yes Sharpe you did. But we have more pressing matters at the moment. Colonel Wellesley tells me reinforcements will be here within the hour, so we need to see what the French are up to.",
"Archer and Evans have gone forward to scout them out. We could follow them.",
"Yes we should. The further away the French are the less chance we have of losing our position at the town outskirts, and by then the reinforcements will be here, and we can counter attack.",
"What about the guns here? Should we spike them?",
"No not yet. If we are forced to withdraw, we can at least turn them and use them against the French. That will buy us a little time. Let's catch up with Archer and Evans.",
"I don't believe it! Look at that! ... Riflemen forward! Rearguard go to cover! Keep your eyes peeled!",
"They've been shot in the back!",
"Then surely they were running away from someone?",
"These are 'Chosen Men'. They know better than to run together! They would have split up if someone were chasing them! One of them would have dropped to cover to return fire.",
"We all make mistakes from time to time, Sharpe.",
"Then explain how they came to be shot in the back at the same time, and fell in EXACTLY the same place, if they were running?",
"Ah! You do have a point there, Sharpe. That is very unlikely. Do you have any ideas?",
"Yes... but you won't like it.",
"Go on.",
"They knew whomever it was that shot them, or more likely who it was, that had them shot.",
"How do you come to that conclusion?",
"Simple... If Haggman and Tongue, fired now, both you and Lieutenant Quelp would fall here, just where you stand. Because you are stood here talking to me and not in a running fight.", 
"Then who could it be? ... Oh no! Not this mysterious midshipman again?",
"It would have to be a British officer of some sort. Who else would they see as a friend when they themselves were following the French?",
"I am starting to get an uneasy feeling about all this.",
"Patrick... take the men and bury Archer and Evans. Have one man on guard at all times... and trust no one. We are going to look at the bay. Follow us when you're ready.",
"What the devil's going on here? I was expecting to have to dive for cover as soon as we got out here, and what do we find? Nothing!",
"This is not what I expected either. Let's see if Quelp has seen anything.",
"Archer and Evans.",
"What do you mean, Archer and Evans?",
"I've been thinking about what I said if Haggman and Tongue had shot you and Lieutenant Quelp.",
"Yes... but what has that to do with Archer and Evans?",
"You wouldn't have fallen down neatly side by side. Each of you would have fallen slightly differently. So...",
"Evans and Archer's bodies were laid neatly side by side...",
"Which meant they were placed there like that to make us think they were coming from the beach.",
"Which answers the how we came to be here. So now the 'why' here?",
"I understand that, but I think we can still turn the situation to our advantage.",
"What do you mean Sharpe?",
"They are sure to have left some sort of a rear guard in the valley back there. I suggest we don't use guns, just swords. That way the sound of gunfire won't alert the main force that we are coming.",
"Good idea we'll do that. Into the fray once more gentlemen. We have a town to relieve.",
"Just a minute, Lieutenant.... I think our Mr. Quelp is in too much of a hurry to get us to go to the beach",
"Sergeant Sharpe! I am the senior officer here! You are just a sergeant, and I say we go to the beach. Now come along.",
"Sharpe! You have been suspicious of Lieutenant Quelp ever since the Larr business. I think it is sour grapes because he saw a knife that Larr had that you missed.",
"Did you see a knife then?",
"Well... No, but I wasn't looking for one. We had more important issues at the time if you remember.",
"That's as may be, but YOU didn't see a knife. Harper and I had searched them both. There was no knife.",
"That maybe so, but I DID see Mr. Quelp save you life on board the 'Renown'. So let's have no more of this nonsense and get to the beach. That's an order.",
"What do you mean Sharpe?",
"So you think we would be going into a trap? We'd better call Mr. Quelp back before he walks into it.",
"No, not a trap. Someone just wants us out of this valley. I'm just saying we shouldn't go to the beach. I suggest that we will find what we are looking for if we go into the other valley.",
"Mr. Quelp! Come back here. Sergeant Sharpe has some thoughts. We need to talk about something.",
"What on earth are you on about Sharpe?",
"I know we doubted him then, but Mr. Quelp saved your life in the smugglers house when Larr tried to stab you.",
"Yes you did. And what was it he said? 'I have released our officers and crew from the brig where they were being held.' If that were the case, WHO released Mr. Quelp? And while I'm at it, why wasn't he shocked to see the bodies of Archer and Evans?",
"You have a point there Sharpe. But he DID shoot the Spaniard now didn't he? How do you explain that?",
"Perhaps the soldier was going to tell us something about Mr. Quelp in order to bargain for his own life or freedom. That perhaps Mr. Quelp was with them on the capture of the ship. Someone had to release the prisoners in the first place for them to take the ship.",
"This is getting far too complicated. We will go to the beach and confront Lieutenant Quelp with these matters and see what he has to say. Come on, let's go.",
"But what has that to do with Mr. Quelp? He was with us the whole time.",
"Because when he's around, the information always gets a little distorted.",
"You're talking about the incident with Larr and the knife aren't you?",
"That maybe so, but I DID see Mr. Quelp save your life on board the 'Renown' when he shot the Spanish soldier.",
"That gives us another problem though.",
"The French must have left some scouts behind to be able to report when we had gone to the beach.",
"You mean we are being watched right at this moment?",
"Yes, but they won't be too close for fear of discovery. I have a plan though. We will go to the beach as they expect us to do.",
"But that's what they want us to do. How will that help us?",
"Because when we leave, their scouts will break cover. I already have two riflemen behind us under cover themselves, just in case we were attacked here. They will take care of the scouts when they break cover.",
"So we can then return and go into the other valley, and they won't be expecting us?",
"Exactly. We should move towards the beach now. We will have to leave the burials till later.",
"We won't have to wait long.",
"We just wait for the sound of gunfire then?",
"No, there won't be any gunfire. If we could hear it, then so could the French. It will be a quiet business. If there is any gunfire, then that will mean something will have gone wrong.",
"Sharpe... Sergeant. Second Battalion 95th Rifles. Sir.",
"That was a close run thing.",
"Yes... Lucky you had two pistols!",
"The French were hiding in the mine. I saw the door move and guessed what was about to happen.",
"It seems more and more likely that it's Sir Arthur they are after.... Here he comes now.",
"This is going to be a close run thing, but I feel a lot happier with three cannon. It's just a shame we can only fire them once though.",
"It all depends on the time we have to reload before the French infantry charge us, but we've been in tighter spots before Sharpe.... Wait! ... Here come the French! We need to get back.",
"That was close, and we have a lot of wounded.",
"Yes it was. Matthews, you and the crew look after the wounded, and send someone back to see what's happening with the troops on the beach. Lieutenant Sharpe and I better report to the Colonel.",
"So if our ship chased the French away, why didn't our troops come back?",
"I was thinking the same thing myself.",
"Well, as officer commanding for the time being, I shall be making some serious investigations into the matter. I'd better be getting back to see what is going on. I'll send your crewmen to report to your ship.",
"Thanks Sharpe. Goodbye for now, but I have a feeling that we will meet again.",
"So, where do we start looking Mr. Hornblower?",
"The tavern is always a good place to start. We'll go there.",
"I suppose that's supposed to make me feel better?",
"Come on Sharpe! He didn't have to tell us all that now did he?",
"No... But what about the midshipman we saw. Why didn't you mention that, if you believe Lieutenant Quelp so much?",
"Because I didn't see him. Now come on, it's a long way to #sisland_Antigua#. We need to get back to the ship.",
"Horatio! Good to see you again.",
"And to see you, Richard. What brings you here?",
"You do! Remember we couldn't understand why the rest of our troops didn't return during the battle with the French?",
"Of course I do. What happened?",
"It seems when our Lt. Quelp and the troops got to the beach they were met by someone who took them to a point where, he said, they would get a better view of the French ship, if it returned.",
"But how did that prevent them from returning?",
"Because where he took them to, was too far along the beach and out of earshot of the valley.",
"So they didn't hear the battle going on?",
"That is what Lt. Quelp said, and our troops confirmed that they heard nothing, but the interesting part is the man who met them. And remember that the troops saw him too.",
"It was a midshipman!",
"A midshipman! But who could it be?",
"That is what we are going to find out. Lt. Quelp has been beached too, and we've been keeping an eye on him, because I'm still not sure about him. Anyway he's here in #sOxbay#, and I suggest we go there and see what he's up to.",
"Well I must admit I've nothing else to do.",
"Good! I knew you would be up for it. If Quelp is involved he will contact the midshipman sooner or later, and I want to be there. And then the game will be up.",
"Good thinking. Let's go to #sOxbay#.",
"We need to get going then, before he slips away again.",
"We can go through the canyon, or I have a small boat and we could sail there.",
"But if we use a boat he could see us coming into shore.",
"Except that this boat is a local fishing boat, no one will take any notice of it.",
"Very well we have a choice, Canyon or Boat.",
"They're all dead! And where's Hunter? ... Patrick, Tongue, take a look around.",
"What the devil is going on here?",
"This makes no sense at all, and yet again if our Mr. Quelp is involved, things don't go according to plan.",
"Well we aren't going to find any answers here.",
"No, and right now we don't have the resources to follow it further. We will have to wait for better times. I must take my men back or we'll be up for desertion! I will be keeping an eye on Mr. Quelp though. See you again sometime Horatio.",
"Yes, take care. I suppose I should go back to #sGreenford#, but it seems the game is over for now.",
"That's some rearguard! It looks like we underestimated them. So what do you think?",
"We could try to take the gun, or surrender.",
"Which is it to be?",
"Let's go for the gun.",
"I believe surrender would be the best course of action in the circumstances.",
"Do you know where we are, Commander?",
"On one of the French islands, and I would guess #sisland_Guadeloupe#, we weren't at sea that long.",
"What do we do now?",
"Nothing. I'm afraid the game is over for us. We will have to wait for the next update!!!!!",
"Here comes Mansfield now.",
"I assume this means they got the French who were in hiding.",
"Commander Hornblower! What brings you to these backwoods?",
"You, and your troop. You have been transferred to my ship for the time being. We need to find your Major Hogan.",
"Hogan? That means there's trouble afoot if he's involved. Last I heard he was on #sisland_Guadeloupe#",
"#sisland_Guadeloupe#. That's French. We will have to land at Anse Casse Bois to have any hope of not being seen.",
"It's worse than that. He pretends to be a planter while he is there and lives on a plantation, which is close to the port.",
"Blast! we would have no chance entering the port, or even coming close to it, and from Anse Casse Bois will mean crossing the whole island without being discovered.",
"I know how we can cross the island undetected.",
"What do you mean?",
"We will sail to #sCharlestown# where we will pick up some friends of mine.",
"#sCharlestown#!? I hope you know what we are doing, Richard.", 
"Let's just say, I have met some interesting people, who know their business.",
"Very well, #sCharlestown# it is. Let's go. It's a long journey.",
"I have sent Patrick off to get the men billeted. We are going to meet Commadante Moreno, she leads a band of guerillas against the French.",
"Guerillas!? Here? What do you mean?",
"It's a long story, which I don't have time to go into now, but I can assure you she can be relied upon.",
"You'll have to tell me more than that, Richard. I have my ship and my men to consider.",
"Quickly then. She was forced to watch her family being murdered by the French army. Since then she has vowed to kill every French soldier she can find, and defeat the French cause.",
"I see. That throws a different light on things. But why isn't she working with us?",
"She does, from time to time, but she thinks we are taking too long to defeat the French, and this truce we have with them now, hasn't helped matters.",
"So why would she help us now?",
"Teresa and I know each other very well, and she also knows Major Hogan. If I tell her what we are up to she will agree to help us.",
"Very well. Where do we have to go to meet the Commadante?",
"Not far. She's here in the port.",
"In the port? Where?",
"She and her band took over the smuggler's house, and business. They run it as a small store. It makes for a good cover and a good way to keep them supplied.",
"That's enough for now. Let's go to the smuggler's house... I mean store. You go ahead. It will give you a chance to prepare her for the meeting.",
"Teresa, may I introduce Commander Horatio Hornblower.... Commander Hornblower, Commadante Teresa Moreno.",
"A pleasure Commadante.",
"Captain, it will be better if the rifles go ahead first. They know how to travel through this type of country and not be seen. Teresa's men can show them the way.",
"Very well. We will follow them.",
"Quickly!! Get into the bushes!",
"Luckily I saw them coming. Better we're not seen I thought. There were a lot of them too, at least a company.",
"Yes, and I don't think they are here for the changing of the guard. There's something going on, but I can't put my finger on it right now.",
"Let's move on. The troops in the fort will be dismissed soon, and I bet a lot of them will head straight to the beach, for a swim.",
"You're right. And we are right in their path. Let's get into the next valley, and quickly.",
"Well looks like we've made it to the plantation.",
"Yes it does and just in time... look at that, behind you.",
"He didn't recognise you in those clothes. He thinks I was returning to his command.",
"I thought that too. What now?",
"Harper, Cooper. Get to the Plantation House. The Major has some clothes for you to change into. Wait there for the Commander. You will be working with him and the Commadante.",
"What will you do?",
"We're outnumbered at least ten to one, so it will be suicide to stay here. I'll take the rest of the troop and we will hide in the rocks and try and pick off some of the French as they come through.",
"And then?",
"If we make it, we will try to get back to the beach.",
"I will look out for you on the beach, but right now, I'd better go back to the house and pick up Harper and Cooper.",
"Glad to see you two. Where's Cooper?",
"If our backs are safe, time to move forward and finish this. Patrick and I will take the back of the plantation. You help the lads in the front here.",
"Forward it is",
"Tongue. Look after the captain. Well, we have our orders, we must get out of here.",
"Captain Murray needs to be tended to. In the meantime Harper, Cooper and I will go and get our uniforms. I'd rather be shot as an officer, not as a spy.",
"Be quick then. We can do something with the bodies here in the meantime. But, double time, if you don't mind. Commander. We can't have much time left before they get the town gates open.", 
"Harper, Cooper. Let's go.",
"We must move out now, sir. There aren't enough of us left to hold off a further assualt, but moving Captain Murray with the injuries he has worries me.",
"We will have to make do. We can't leave him. Give the order to move out.",
"Damn! He was a good man. Harris, Haggman stay behind and bury the Captain, then catch us up. The rest of you, move out in groups. We meet on the beach.",
"They should get through. When the French arrive, they will think we are still hiding somewhere here, so they will waste a lot of time looking for us.",
"I hope you're right. Not only being exhausted, the men are down over Captain Murray's death.",
"Funny. They didn't seem bothered about Dunnitt.",
"Hmmm... We'd better get moving ourselves.",
"So far, so good, Commander.",
"Stay watchful. We aren't home yet.",
"I must take the troops back to the barracks and report.",
"Very good, Lieutenant.",
"Harper, get back to the ship... I've seen one of these before. It is a signal tower. It has a semaphore on top and it signals the fort about the ships it sees coming towards the fort.",
"So, as our ships approached, it would signal the fort, and they would be ready to blast our ships out of the water. ",
"That's about it. No ship can get anywhere near the port without the fort being ready for them. ",
"It looks just like a lighthouse.",
"That's the clever part. Unless you know about it, you would never know what it was. You would assume it was just a lighthouse.",
"We must get back and report this.",
"You always did have a good eye, Teresa. Glad you made it Captain. We were beginning to think we were stuck here. We were quite happy when we saw Teresa's ship.",
"I'll be happier when the 'Hotspur' comes into view.",
"We wait, I suppose. How went the battle?",
"Not good. We did repulse the French for the moment, but Major Dunnitt, Captain Murray and a lot of the lads were killed.",
"That's sad to hear.",
"There is some good news. Harper and Cooper found something you ought to come and take a look at.",
"But we can't leave the beach. The 'Hotspur' will miss us.",
"Haggman and Cooper and the rest, can wait for the 'Hotspur'. You, me and Harper will go and take a look at what we found. It won't take long, and Harper has your uniform, so you can change as we go. Follow us.",
"There you are, Horatio. Let's go see Wolfe. I've been looking forward to this.",
"Lead on.",
"Leave him to me, Horatio. Five minutes with Haggman and he'll be wishing we'd hanged him.",
"I'm sure Wolfe will want to avoid such unpleasantness. Won't you, Wolfe?",
"Just remember, Wolfe. You're no hawk, more like a rat. Do anything funny and Haggman will make you wish we'd hanged you.",
".",
"I brought Harper and Haggman. Just in case Quelp has any more surprises for us.",
"Good thinking, Lieutenant.  Wolfe, where are you supposed to meet Quelp?",
"Harper, Haggman - get to cover and keep your eyes open.",
"There's Quelp. Let's find out what he has to say.",
"Harper! Haggman! Those aren't British soldiers, they're French in disguise!",
"You go and take care of the Voltigeurs, Lieutenant. I'll deal with Quelp",
"And Haggman, tell the rest of the Chosen Men to join us here. There are probably more of these Voltigeurs around here somewhere.",
"What makes you say that, Lieutenant?",
"The Frogs wouldn't leave troops like this under command of a turncoat like Quelp. They'd want their own officer in charge. And he's not here.",
"So there may be more further along. But they wouldn't want to wear British uniforms in town. Telling the garrison why they're in British uniform would be a security risk, and not telling them would cause trouble.",
"Then they'll have to change uniform somewhere else. If we're lucky, we might catch them doing it.",
"Let's go.",
"I don't think we'll find the Voltigeurs here, Horatio. This is just a small village.",
"And if all these people saw the Voltigeurs then their secret would be throroughly blown. Very well, let's look nearer the town.",
"Looks like Haggman got some more riflemen to join us.",
"Good. When they get here we can go to attack the Voltigeurs.",
"There they are. Chosen Men, ATTACK!",
"Leave some for me!",
"With your permission, my men will escort the officer to the ship.",
"That would be most helpful, Lieutenant. By the way, there's something I've been meaning to ask you. When we were interrogating Wolfe, you said 'Five minutes with Haggman and he will wish we had hanged him'. Just what was Haggman going to do to him?",
"Sing.",
"Sing? He's that bad?",
"No, he's that good. Five minutes of Haggman singing about the afterlife and you'd wish they'd hang you just so you could find out what he's singing about.",
"Then I hope he sings something more cheerful when he's aboard my ship!",
"It was good to serve with you once more, Horatio. But the 95th are due to leave for Europe any time now. We'll be joining Sir Arthur Wellesley in Portugal.",
"The pleasure was mine, Richard. Good luck in Europe. Give my regards to Sir Arthur Wellesley. For that matter, send Napoleon my regards too!",
"I'll do that. Goodbye, Horatio.",
"Goodbye, Richard.",
