"Mr. Hornblower. Looking for Mr. Wellard I assume?",
"Yes Doctor. How is he?",

"Gentlemen. The Captain lives, but he has lost his memory. What happened last night?",
"It seems the Captain fell into the hold Doctor.",
"Fell into the hold? Fell... or was he pushed? Who saw it?",
"Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Wellard and I were on deck sir. We heard the Captain coming along the deck, but we saw nothing.",
