"Cheer up Horatio. You'll get another ship soon.",
"I hope so Maria. I do hope so.",
"I'm Maria. Mother's gone for a sleep.",
"Ah! I'm Horatio, Horatio Hornblower, late of His Majesty's Navy.",
"You're not happy about being decommissioned are you?",
"I won't know what to do with myself. I only know a life at sea.",
"Don't worry, I'll keep you company, and you can use my Father's old tartane, it's moored in the port. He used to use it for fishing when he was home. It's no good for the open sea though.",
"Thank you. I might do that. I'm going to have a lot of time on my hands.",
"A penny for your thought Horatio.",
"Oh! ... Hello Maria. I was just wishing the fleet would sail in, and I could get a position on a ship again.",
"Horatio! You mean you are tired of my company already?",
"No! No! Maria. It's just that I've been here three months now, and I am so far behind with the rent. I need a position in order to earn some money.",
"I was only teasing Horatio. And don't worry, I have paid this week's rent for you. Mother won't be after you for now. By the way, I noticed you had pawned your sword. You won't get a position without one. Here you are, take this.",
"Maria... You are such a good friend.",
"I hope I am more than that Horatio.",
"Maria... Er...",
"Anyway, I have some news which should cheer you up.",
"Really? And what might that be?",
"There are some soldiers in town who say they served with you. Riflers I think they said. I told them I would come and find you. They are in the tavern.",
"Riflemen! Maria. And thank you, I would like to see them again. Please excuse me, I will go to the tavern now.",
"Er! Sorry mother I forgot. Mr. Hornblower gave me half-a-crown this morning. It's up in my room.",
"She doesn't mean to be so hard on you.",
"I think she does Maria, and with good reason. I'm not a good lodger, not by any means.",
"I think you are a real gentleman Horatio.",
"I must go into town now Maria. I think I have a way to get some rent money. I will see you later.",
"Mr. Hornblower. You're not leaving us sir, surely? My mother's tongue sometimes runs away with her... ",
"I've been given command of a ship. I sail tomorrow.",
"Then let me pack for you sir.",
"That's very kind but I've already done it.",
"But I'll never see you again sir.",
"I'm sorry, but I have my duty.",
"Mr. Hornblower, sir. I am ashamed sir, that you should see us like this. It happened so quickly. I didn't know we were in arrears, and the bailiffs did not listen and now we cannot earn our release.",
"You were my friend in a time of need, Maria, allow me to be yours.",
"No sir, you mustn't.",
"It's too late Maria. It's done.",
"Thank you sir. I don't know what to say.",
"Say nothing Maria. Just go and pay your debts. I must get back to sea now, but I will come back again.",
"Mr. Hornblower, sir. I saw the Hotspur, sir, in the harbour. I hoped it might signal your return.",
"It must be good for you to be home again.",
"...",
"It is. Thank you, sir, and also good to see you. Come in.",
"You.. er.. have enough for the rent?",
"I hope to get a position as a governess and I can't be a burden on your charity.",
"You're no burden I assure you.",
"No Mr. Hornblower, I can't. There's a word for a woman who accepts money from a man.",
"Yes, and that word is friend.",
"I treasure your friendship. But I cannot keep both your money and my reputation.",
"My apologies... of course... I should have...",
"Maria please don't cry. If I were to ask, Maria... would you.",
"Would I...?",
"Will you marry me?",
"Oh Horatio!",
"Horry! I'm so glad you're back and safe! I hope you'll stay a long time.",
"(Thinks: 'Horry'? <wince>) I'm glad to be back with you too, Maria. But I'm afraid my duties at sea won't allow me to stay for very long.",
"Hello, dearest! I'm so happy you came by. It seems like forever since I saw you last!",
"So, tell me, ",
", what's been going on around here?",
"((( ",
" tells you that nothing very important has happened. )))",
