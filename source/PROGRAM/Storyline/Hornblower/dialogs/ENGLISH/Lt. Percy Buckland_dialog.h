"Hello Hornblower. All's well with you I trust?",
"Yes thank you, Lieutenant.",
".",
"I see the fort is ours, I think my plan came together rather well, rather well indeed.... That is Lieutenant Quelp if I'm not mistaken? How did he come to be here?",
"Yes, Lieutenant. He was a prisoner here Sir. It is a long story, but doubtless he will tell you about it once on board.",
"Good. Good. Well ",
", pray present the Fort Commander in order that I might receive his formal surrender as Captain of the 'Renown'.",
"It will be my pleasure, Captain Sawyer.",
"...",
"Get yourself up to the quarterdeck mister. #sCharlestown# is on the island of #sisland_Quebradas Costillas#. When we clear the harbour give the helmsman a course of East by South.",
"East by South. Aye Aye, Lieutenant. [THINKS: Oh dear! The ship's moving. I'm starting to feel sea-sick already!]",
"What's the matter man? You've turned quite green.",
"Bluuurk....",
"Ah! Hornblower, there you are. Captain Pellew wants us to put the new crew through their paces. He wants to be sure that they are ready for battle before we sail. We are to sail to #sGreenford# on #sisland_Oxbay#, pick up two officers, then return here and board the captain so he may inspect the crew.",
"Yes, Lieutenant.",
"I shall be acting captain, so I will be expecting some hard work from you. At least it might provide some distraction from your continual vomiting! Ha! Ha!",
"Amusing. Most amusing, lieutenant. Let's get on with it then.",
"Good God, man! What a mess. Mr Kennedy! Perhaps you would be so kind as to assist Mr. Hornblower with his ablutions!",
"I'll be alright sir.",
"What kept you gentlemen? We have the goods delivered already. That must be a really slow boat you have.",
"Never mind, the work's done now. Don't wait about too long. There's a French fort in the next valley, so we need to get back on board.",
"Oh! Er.. aye lieutenant. We'll get back to the ship.",
"What the devil happened here? We heard the commotion from the beach as we were about to board the ship's boat.",
"I'm not sure, Lieutenant. I was... unconscious.",
"This is a pretty mess, and a good man down to boot. It is each of you, one man's word against the other. The Captain will have to decide your fate. Get yourselves back aboard ship, and consider yourselves under arrest.",
"Kennedy, get some men and carry Clayton's body back aboard. We will have to bury him at sea. The agent gave us orders which say we are to sail directly to #sRedmond#, so we cannot stay here any longer. I said get aboard, you two. NOW!",
"I am nervous at leaving the ship, being acting captain. You must collect the officers on your own. You need to go to Naval H.Q.. It is near the prison in the main town.",
"Aye aye, Lieutenant.",
"Aye, aye Captain. I will call him over... Colonel Ortega, if you please, sir.",
"Good Day Colonel. I am Captain Buckland of His Majesty's Ship 'Renown' and I accept your formal surrender.",
"Now, Mr. Sharpe, kindly escort Lieutenant Quelp and the prisoners to the ship.",
", I shall require you to stay behind and blow up the fort.",
"Blow up the fort, Sir?",
" Talking to the crew in the bay it seems the whole island has been taken over by escaped slaves. They have had the fort under siege for weeks and we could not possibly take them on.",
"I see, Sir. Very well I will meet you in the far bay when it is done.",
"We will wait as long as we can for you but, if the slave army shows up, I may have to put to sea. You understand my position, I'm sure?",
"Aye aye, Captain.",
"What a calamity! What a calamity!",
"Are you hurt, Sir?",
"Can you see any blood?",
"The 'Renown' is recovered Sir.",
"I can see it's recovered, and I can see who recovered it!",
"I'm very sorry Sir, I was unaware that Mr. Bush had come aboard. He should have made himself known Sir, I was forward, inspecting the anchor cables.",
"It is hardly surprising. Doctor Clive has him on Laudanum almost continuously.",
"You mean he is drugged? Then he is not fit to command the ship surely?",
"That is not for us to say. It is Doctor Clive's decision.",
"But we are nearing #sisland_Cuba# and the enemy. We can't go on like this. We need an able commander.",
"Well, gentlemen, I am pleased that the Captain is alive, but I must now assume the mantle of command.",
"I think it would be better if you were to address me as Captain, Mr Hornblower.",
"Good, good. Now to my plan. We have reached Playa de Sabana. I intend that we blast the fort to kingdom come from here in the bay.",
"Captain... The fort is high on a cliff. We won't be able to elevate the guns high enough.",
"Oh! And what would you suggest, Mr. Hornblower?",
"That we take a landing party on shore and make a land assault. That way we don't risk the ship... Captain.",
"Yes, yes. That is what I was about to propose. Then make ready. Mr. Bush, Mr. Hornblower, Mr Kennedy get the men ready, we will launch the boats at once.",
"Sir, I protest! I had just had the weight of commanding the ship thrust upon me. I had to plan the fort attack. All of which would not have happened if the Captain had not been pushed down the hold by Lieutenant Horatio Hornblower!",
