"Oh, friend, I'm afraid I'm too busy to speak at the moment. I've got a new idea, and I'm a bit distracted.",
"Sounds good. Just be careful, and don't blow us all up.",
"Help me! Help me!",
"Hold on. I'm trying to!",
"Help me! Help me!",
"No thanks, I wouldn't risk my life for you.",
"Oh! Thank you, thank you so much, ",
", if it wasn't for you, those simpletons would've torn me to pieces.",
"You're welcome.",
"Excuse me, friend, but I have an experiment that needs my attention, so I must take leave of you now.\nDon't be upset. A couple of very nice people have joined me at my house. I think that you'll be pleased to talk to them.",
"Good, I'm interested to meet your guests.",
"I am glad to see you, where is ",
"Danielle",
"?",
"Hmm...I thought #spronoun# was already here.",
"Oh no! What happened to you, ",
"? You are not yourself...look at your clothes, and those bruises, and you're all wet!",
"Let me catch my breath! Bring me some wine, I'm dying of thirst.",
"Here it is.",
"Is that it? If that's a yacht, then I'm a king! That's just a fishing boat!",
"That's all I can do for you, ",
", and don't be upset with me.",
"I'm sorry. I suppose I don't have a choice. I'll have to look for ",
"Danielle",
" with this tub.",
"Here's your wine. Now tell me what happened?",
"It's a long story. Is ",
"Danielle",
" here? I can't see #spronoun3# ship.",
"No, #spronoun# hasn't come yet.",
"Blast! That #sgirl# can't stay in one place for more than a moment. As luck would have it, I've lost my ship!",
"Hmm...I have a small yacht. Maybe it can help you?",
"A yacht? You old fox, why didn't you tell me sooner?",
"Well, it's a very small yacht...",
"Show it to me.",
"No, #spronoun# hasn't come yet.",
"Blast! That #sgirl# can't stay in one place for more than a moment. I'll need to find #spronoun2#.",
"What are you talking about? I owe you my life! May I know your name?",
"My name is ",
", I'm a captain.",
"How interesting! I've got a couple of inventions that may be installed on a ship.\nOh, why are we standing here? I'm so grateful to you for rescuing me...I insist on going to my house now, I want to repay your kindness. Come, come.",
"Fine, let's go and have a look at your home. Just don't do anything with my ship.",
"We need to get back to the ship. I fear the destruction of the temple may cause an earthquake, or even something worse! The Incans were experts at making elaborate traps.",
"Traps that can cause an earthquake? Sounds pretty far-fetched to me.",
"Yes, yes! All right, let's assume there won't be an earthquake - but the inscriptions on the walls of the temple do mention a severe penalty that will wipe those who commit sacrilege off the face of the Earth.",
"The temple falling down around our ears was pretty severe. That was probably the penalty. We should still try to look for the treasure.",
"Captain, no! No treasure on Earth is worth losing one's life!",
"Well, the ground seems to be a little unstable now, so perhaps we should leave and come back. If there's going to be a volcanic eruption, I don't want to be standing here when it happens.",
"Yes, I guess that's not such a bad idea...",
"#sPronoun_upper# could have waited for the answer, at least.",
"Let's follow #spronoun3# example, ",
". I'll go to the right, and you, captain, will go straight. If you don't mind.",
"What's the difference!? Just try not to get lost.",
"I doubt it. The inscriptions say the trap is by the entrance to the sun god's alcove. It looks like this is where the labyrinth starts.",
"Labyrinth?",
"Yes, labyrinth. Didn't I mention it? In order to get to the treasures, you must go through the labyrinth. I suppose only one of these passageways will lead us to them.",
"I think the ones who created this temple had a fondness for jokes.",
"Be careful at the temple, my friends. It's written in the tablet that there is a trap at the entrance of the sun god's alcove.\nAlas, there's no explanation of how to disable the trap, but it's said you can find the instructions inside the temple.",
"Thanks for the warning. Have you already finished the translation?",
"Yes, but the papers are damp and wrinkled. I couldn't make out everything that was written. There was a part about the alcove and some god that is asleep now. I don't think you should pay much heed to this. It's sure to be a native fairytale.",
"Blast! Where are the treasures?",
"I suppose that the entrance to the treasury, or to be more precise, the burial vault, is in the alcove.",
"Go ahead then.",
"Wait, the thing is, you can only enter the temple when it is lit with sunlight! Some complex mechanism, I don't really know...",
"Is that so? We'll have to wait for the sun, then. I hope the rainy season doesn't start today.",
"If my memory hasn't failed me, we were going to the temple.",
"Ah, yes, that's right.",
"Oh, Captain ",
"! What are you doing here? Did they also put you in jail?",
"No, my friend, I came here to rescue you.",
"Rescue me? How? I don't think you'll be able to persuade the warden to free me without an order from the governor!",
"I've already talked him into it, ",
".",
"Is that really true? You are an amazing person, captain, but why did you come here to help me all of a sudden?",
"To be honest, I want you to do me a favour in return.",
"Hmm...I'm ready to do that, captain, but maybe we can continue this conversation some other place?",
"Sure. Let's go to the lighthouse, and I'll tell you everything on the way there.",
"...Foolhardy and reckless! I can't even believe that people are capable of that...",
"Everyone has his own particular notion of fun.",
"So, you want me to translate the native text on this piece of paper? You're especially interested in the part that describes how to get inside the temple, am I right?",
"Yes. You said that you know the native language.",
"Yes, yes...I spent a lot of time studying the local aboriginal population...and, ",
", if you're setting out on an expedition in search of that temple, I'll sail with you!",
"...For what reason?",
"I know the reason why you are going there...but I assure you, I don't need that. I just want to be there to see everything and maybe make an outstanding discovery!",
"Hmmm...I don't want you to suffer the trials of the sea voyage...",
"That's nonsense! I swear, ",
", if you don't agree to take me with you, I won't translate a single word of this text!",
"Then, it's settled. I'll take you with us.",
"Excellent! I'm so grateful to you! As to the translation, I need some time. I think it will take me a couple of days. The dialect is fairly unusual.",
"We'll repair the ship and prepare for sail.",
"Ah, it's you, captain! I've almost finished the translation. I need one more week and I'll be done.",
"We can't wait. Why don't you continue translating during the voyage?",
"Yes, that's a good idea, why not? Will I get a headache when I am sailing? I guess not.... Do I get sea-sick? No, I don't think so.... All right, I agree. But, now I'm curious...what's the hurry?",
"I suppose the battle in the harbour went unnoticed, so perhaps I should explain...",
"A battle? What battle? In which harbor?",
"...Governor Silehard is not going to make us a present of the colony...and I suspect he plans to hang us at the first opportunity.",
"Hang? Ah, I see. I'll continue my work during the voyage. I must say that we got lucky, setting off at this time. It's said it's possible to enter the bay of #sisland_Khael Roa# only twice a year.",
"Why can't ships approach the island at any other time?",
"According to the text it's a natural phenomenon that affects the tides.",
"That's probably why ",
"Raoul Rheims",
" couldn't get to the temple.",
"Maybe. But, it also mentions other perils. Perils that await those who seek the heart of the sun god's temple.",
"Keep reading. You'll have the next few days to investigate everything. Let's get to the ship.",
"By the way, captain, I'll need a stateroom, and it would be nice if it's somewhere near the stern so that the cries of the crew don't distract me from my work on the translation.",
"Hmm. All right. You'll have a stateroom.",
"Don't hurry, my friends. We are standing on the threshold. Somewhere around here should be the secret entrance to the burial chamber.",
"Do you think we should start tapping the walls?",
"Not at all. These pictures on the walls should tell us how to find the burial chamber's entrance and warn us of possible traps.",
"Aren't all the dangers behind us now?",
"No, I doubt it. The native engineers did their best to protect their temple. I am sure there are many dangers waiting for us.\nWell, we'll see soon enough. Now, let me think for a minute.",
"Yes, please.",
"Oh, no! Don't touch!",
"What's the matter?",
"This is a trap.... Oh no! You've already touched the stone!",
"Oh no! Tell me what happened?",
"This is the final trap left by the creators of the temple! Why didn't you wait! I could've read the inscriptions to find out how to avoid it, but no, you had to touch something!",
"If that's a trap, why we are still alive?",
"If we wait any longer, we'll be dead for sure! The trap opens a channel that brings water from the mountain lake to the caves under the temple. \nThe volcano's hot chamber sitting under the temple is still active, so can you imagine what's going to happen when that water hits the burning hot lava!",
"Hmmm. Will it be...? You think it might get a little stuffy in here?",
"Stuffy? The steam will blow up the temple! We must leave!",
"What about the treasure?",
"Forget the treasure! I've got to get out of here!",
"Isn't there a way? ...",
"Take me back home, Captain. Please? I'm afraid this is far more adventure than I need, at my age.",
"You're right, let's set sail.",
"Please, Captain! We have to leave!",
"All right!",
"Well Captain, that certainly was an adventure!",
"That's true, Clement. I'm glad we all made it safely through.",
"Terrible that we can't get back into the temple to study more about those lost people.",
"I'm sorry we couldn't stay to find the gold, if there was any.",
"Oh I think there is gold there, Captain, it's just a matter of figuring out a way to get it....Hmmm...",
"Clement, if anyone can do it, you can. Thanks again for your help.",
"...",
"Clement?",
"Could you take me back to my lighthouse, please, ",
"? I really do need to study all the notes I've been taking.",
"Certainly, Clement.",
