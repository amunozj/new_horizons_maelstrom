"Over there, in the house by the dock, the one raised up on pilings. That's the port office. Now go get the permit. I'll wait for you here.",
"Yes sir, I'll be back soon.",
"Excellent. Let's get underway.",
"We can set sail immediately.",

"Are you an enemy spy, then? If not, go and see the governor. He should be able to guarantee your safety.",
"He'll also probably want a lot of money. I'm not paying to escort you, I'm being paid! If you won't sail round to Octopus Bay then you can find another escort. And you can also explain to the governor why the army on #sisland_Oxbay# still has no supplies.",
"Very well, I'll go to see the governor.",
"Alright, it seems I have no choice. Return to your ship and I shall sail round to join you.",
"I'm on my way.",
