"Hola, girl. What may you want from an old wench like me?",
"It's terribly complicated, Señorita. There was a book of poetry read aloud at your husband's funeral service - my condolences - which in fact belongs to an appointee of the crown, and I must return it to him.",
"Ah, yes. I only remember this because my late husband HATED poetry and to me, it almost ruined the funeral. But there was a lady in the church that day who loved it, so she asked if she could have the book.",
"Who was the lady? I need to know!",
"I don't know her, lass. Wondered the whole day what she was doing there and if she was the floozie of my husband. But I think my son knows her. Perhaps she is his floozie too... You should ask him, he's always swimming at the beach.",
"Thank you, Señorita. [THINKS:] Here we go again...",
"Hola, girl. Do I know you?",
"No, Señorita. [THINKS:] Is she forgetful?",
