"Ah! Beatrice... Little Beatrice. I would recognise those eyes anywhere, how you've grown. You got your father's letter then?",
"Uncle Manny! I nearly didn't recognise you. I haven't seen you for so long. What are you doing here? ",
"Ah! I was dreading this bit. It's a long story, but to keep it short, when you were born you had a twin sister. Your poor father however, had fallen on hard times, very hard times, and could not afford to keep you both. So I agreed to bring up your sister as my own daughter.",
"A twin sister! But, why did nobody tell me? What's her name? Where is she? What is she doing?",
"Slow down, slow down. I joined the Navy to better myself, and when you were about three years old I was shipped out to the Caribbean, where I have been ever since, and of course I brought your sister, Bonnie, with me. She knows about you. I told her a year or two back.",
"Bonnie, so that's her name. Where is she now?",
"A step at a time, a step at a time. By the time your father passed away his fortunes had much improved. He had been given a map to a vast treasure, which he has sent to me. He wants you and Bonnie to share in it because he feels he let you both down as children.",
"He didn't let me down. I just chose to go to sea because I like the adventure.",
"That's good to hear. Anyway, here is the map, some money and a few other items that you may find of use. A spyglass and a compass to find your way at sea, and some decent weapons to defend yourself on land, should it be necessary\nBonnie you will find in the port. She has been watching you since you landed, and if I know her, she has brought some clothes to have the same style as you! Go find her Beatrice, and then go get the treasure. It's all marked on the map, with some notes in the margin.",
"Ha Ha! You should, I've bounced you on my knee a few times. Not recognise your uncle Emmanuel, your father's brother. Whatever next!",
"Uncle Manny! But I was only a child then, I do remember you of course. But, what are you doing here? And what does my father's letter mean? 'Sister'. I don't have a sister.",
"I will need to think this all through, but I can do that after I have met Bonnie. Thank you Uncle Manny... and goodbye.",
"What are you waiting for, Beatrice? Your sister and your family's heritage are waiting!",
"I'm on my way, Uncle!",
