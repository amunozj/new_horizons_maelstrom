"Hello there, Blaze. Any success so far?",
"I'm working on it, little Bea. But first, I need you to sail the ship to #sGrand Cayman# and wait there for me.",
"Are you expecting any problems?",
"Let's just say I have a little rendez-vous with some French corsairs. Drop that worried face of yours! They're idiots! I have a plan to make them strangle each other rather soon... Just sail to #sGrand Cayman# and we'll meet at the dock later.",
"Dock? I've heard it's not much more than a beach. But very well, I will see you there. And idiots or not, be careful!",
"Don't worry, little Bea. This is going to be easy.",
"And don't call me...!",
"Go now, go!", // 7
"There you are, Blaze. I started to think you might have gotten arrested. What's new?",
"What's new? I'm thirsty, that's what new! There's not a single grogshop in the jungle, can you believe that?",
"Fine, here's a bottle of rum. Today, you deserved it.", // 10
"Aah, good rum! I'm feeling better already! Now where is Bonnie, by the way?",
"She's over there somewhere I think, flirting with the dock workers. But did you find out anything useful about our little 'map problem'?",
"What do you think? Same thing as last time. A new map full of crosses, a new crazy story about some mysterious pirate captain. I tell you the details later.",
"Hmm, fine. Off to the third and last name on our map it is then. There we will hopefully get some conclusions at last.",
"Let's leave this godforsaken rock, then!", // 15
"One last thing: Ehm, who's the new girl you brought along?",
"Oh, that's Annie. She wants to come with us to sea, I hope that's okay. Annie, this is my sister. The bossy one.",
"Alright then, I guess Bonnie and me, we always welcome more girls on the ship. Glad to meet you, Annie.",
"Yes, yes. Blah, blah. Let's go now!", // 19
"That's not a good idea! Our relationship with the Spanish hasn't been all that sunshiny as of late.",
"Fine, then why don't you just sail out to the open sea a short distance, and return back here in a few hours. Then we'll meet again right here.",
"Very well. I'll be back at Eden Rock later. And idiots or not, be careful!", // 22
"She's sulking in the cabin because, I quote, 'she's booored'. But did you find out anything useful about our little 'map problem'?", // 23
"What's happening, Blaze? The lookout spotted a pirate ship near the island!", // 24
"You're telling me old news, little Bea. Right now I need a favour. I must borrow the ship for an hour or two... To attack the corsairs!",
"Are you mad, Blaze?! You, commanding a naval battle? You?",
"Come on, little Bea! You always say I'm a lousy sailor, a terrible navigator and couldn't tell the front end of a cannon from the back! This is my chance to prove you wrong. Besides, we don't get what we came for with these corsairs in our way!",
"Hmm... fine! If you believe it helps us on our journey, I give you command of the ship -- and permission to fight pirates! Just be careful. Bonnie and I will observe your progress from land\nRemember all I taught you about battling at sea! And never call me little Bea ever again!",
"I can't remember you ever taught me anything about battles, little Bea.",
"HOW DARE YOU CALL ME...!",
"Got to run! Naval battle, here I come!", // 31
"Not too bad, Blaze! You pulled out a nice victory out there!",
"I did, didn't I? Ha! You must admit, your big brother is a fury at sea!",
"Now get off the high horse, and don't pretend you're Francis Drake.",
"You are right, I'm not. I'm much better! Ehm, sorry about the scratches on the ship by the way.",
"It's okay. One has to make a sacrifice from time to time. Even a proud ship owner like me! Now what's going on with that hermit?",
"I still have to talk with him, be right back.",
"Alright, meet me back here when you're done. Ehm, I'll start some repair work in the meantime.",
"You do that!", // 39
