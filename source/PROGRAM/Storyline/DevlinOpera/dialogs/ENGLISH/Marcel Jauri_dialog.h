"You are very welcome, but actually I just really wanted to speak with you.",
"Of course, now we have more than enough time!",
"Look, this is a bit strange, but I found your name on this map... Does this mean anything to you? Do perhaps the other two names mean anything?",
"Well, well, well, I'll be damned... Yes, this does mean something. A connection to an odd instruction I was given a long time ago... Funny how you wait for that moment your whole life in a way, and when it arrives, you're still surprised...",
"Please tell me!",
"Many years ago, when I had just moved to #sSanto Domingo#, I met a seafaring man who called himself 'Captain E'. Who told me he was waiting for his ship, which was coming for him from another island. He lived in my house for that brief period of time, and we became friends. Even though I never learned, who he truly was\nOne day, he said that his ship had come for him. Not to the port, but to a deserted cove. Before he left, he gave me a sealed paper, and said that one day, two redheaded girls and a blonde fellow would come for me, knowing nothing but my name from the inscription of a map. Then, and only then, shall I hand out this paper.",

"So here it is. I have been carrying this sealed piece of paper ever since, but never have I seen the seafaring man again. I hope it helps you in whatever quest you are pursuing.",
"Thank you so much, Mister Jauri! I must leave now, and show this to my brother and sister immediately!",
