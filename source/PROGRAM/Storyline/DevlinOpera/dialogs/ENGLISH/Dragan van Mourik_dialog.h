"Ehm, good evening. I'm sorry, but I can't tell whether you are a mugger or a missionary.",

"I see... Hey, I get an idea! Would you mind giving your comfortable cloak to me?",
"I love this cloak, so this would cost you 25 reales.",
"No problem, here is the money.",
"25 reales? Ehm, actually I have changed my mind. Enjoy your stroll.",
"Here you have it. And remember: Only wash it by hand in cold water. Use salt for red wine stains.",
"I appreciate it. Hopefully you don't get a cold on your way home.",
