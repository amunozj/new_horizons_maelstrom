"So you are le savage, that killed my men? That is brave of you. Brave and suicidal. I am Captain Godefroi Bonamy of le 'Pastenague'. How would you like to die? Should we keel-haul you or just shoot you right here?",
"I am Blaze Devlin. Look, I'm sorry I killed your men. I just hate all sorts of mutineers, and that is why I lost my temper.",
"Excusez-moi? What are you talking about?",
"*Sigh* You see, I'm a corsair just like you. I was Captain of the 'Porky Pie' and we set sail from the port of Birmingham to capture Spanish ships between #sisland_Cuba# and Florida...",
"...",
"...then all of sudden, my crew decided to mutiny and left me on this god-forsaken island. I have been living in the woods for almost three months.",
"When I spied on your men, as anybody would do, and heard them talk about mutiny, I just got so angry! I grabbed my sword, the rest is history.",
"I don't understand un single mot! Why should they talk about mutiny? My men are no mutineers, Monsieur!",
"Believe what you want, but I heard these three talk about mutiny loud and clear.",
"Zut alors! C'est true? If that's so, then you helped me out here! Ha! I already wanted to chop you, then I learn you got rid of the mutineers for me! Ha!",
"Well, some of the mutineers, but only three...",
"What?! You mean there are more men in my crew planning a mutiny?",
"They talked about others, so I understood there are more mutineers. I couldn't hear any names or details, but they seemed to mention an officer who's in charge of the conspiracy.",
"Zut alors! An officer is the leader of the mutineers?! That is incroyable! But who could it be? Is it le first mate, Mad Kay Hubecher? Or is it le boatswain, Crazy Luc Helveur?",
"As I said, I couldn't hear a name.",
"Sacré Bleu! How can I catch the mutineers then?",
"If you allow me to make a suggestion: You could separate the two officers and let them each work with their closest sailors. Then observe the groups, and look where a mutiny might be brewing.",
"This is une excellent idea! And you are going to help me! Unless you still want to be keel-hauled\nGo back to the island, where le first mate and his men are already working on the base camp. See if you can figure anything out!\nIn the meantime, I will stay on le ship and keep an eye on le boatswain and his part of the crew.",
"Understood, I will take one of the row boats and come back, as soon as I have new informations. [THINKS:] He is even dumber than I imagined!", // 18
"This took you long enough! I almost believed you ran away. Now, have you found anything at le camp?",
"I was observing the first mate and his men closely, and couldn't make out any sign of betrayal. They seem loyal to the bone to me, talked highly of you and for even more good news, they found a small chest of gold half-buried in the camp!",
"Gold? That's some good news indeed. But first things first: If le first mate is loyal to les bones as you say, then doesn't this mean le boatswain is the ringleader of the mutineers?",
"That's my conclusion as well. Where is he?",
"He's supervising work in the cargo hold. They're putting aside the powder kegs to make more room for le plunder!",
"No doubt he would choose some of his fellow mutineers for this job, so they can secretely plot their betrayal! Have you got any more loyal men on board?",
"Yes, my two servants would go through hell for me. We can count on them!",
"Then get these two servants, armed and ready! Then we're going to pay the mutineers in the cargo hold a little visit...", // 26
"Crazy Luc Helveur, you are a traitor and a mutineer! Now lay down your arms or we will cut you down like the pigs you all are!",
"...", // 28
"Do I look like I'm joking? Men, draw your swords!",
"You will go down, Crazy Luc Helveur! En garde, cochon!", // 30
"HA-HA! Les mutineers are no more! Crazy Luc Helveur can rot in hell!",
"Good fight, Captain! This will serve as a warning for any future would-be mutineers!",
"Now on to le next thing, you mentioned le first mate found some gold ashore?",
"That's true, they uncovered a half-buried chest of Spanish coins in the abandoned fort.",
"I want to see that and congratulate le first mate on his finding, before I take my reasonably large share! Let's go ashore, where you will lead me to this fort!",
"Alright, Captain. Follow me!", // 36
"Lead us to le camp now!",
"I'm trying! This jungle is hard to navigate...", // 38
"Sacre bleu! Why did le first mate and his men just attack us? You assured me they weren't with les mutineers!",
"And you just believed everything I said, five minutes after first meeting me? You really are the king of idiots, Captain Bonamy!",
"What? You lied to me? Cochon! Filthy Englishman!",
"You are not in a good position, Captain. Your most valuable crewmembers have all passed away within a few hours, and now you are here, at the mercy of my blade. But you have yourself to blame for that.",
"You will pay for this, Devlin! Draw your sword!",
"With pleasure, Captain!", // 44
"Where are we going? I believe this path leads to le Spanish settlement! You are supposed to lead us to le camp!",
"You're right, we took a wrong turn. Let's go the other way.",
