"What in the Lords name is going on here? Officer Balboa! Have you been drinking?!",
"...",
"This is unbelievable! A disgrace! A representative of the Spanish crown drinking and roaming the streets when he should have returned to the ship hours ago! This must have repercussions of the most severe kind. You, woman! Help me get this disgrace of a man to the ship!",
"Of course, Señor. [THINKS:] I have no choice!",
"Uff, who would have imagined a drunk man was this heavy to carry!",
"Please, Señor! What happens to Officer Balboa now?",
"What do you think will happen to him?! The man is going to hang from the gallows of #sSantiago# first thing in the morning! Officer? Don't make me laugh. Never before has a man in his position dishonoured the treasure fleet like that!",
"Please, Captain! You can't do that. You have to listen to me!", //7
"Pah! Why should I listen to a girl who's green behind the ears? There are rules. And your friend Balboa has been flouting them.",
"Rocoso Balboa is a true Spanish patriot, Señor. In the tavern, he was raising his glass to Diego Velazquez de Cuellar, Hernan Cortes and the conquest of the new world.",
"Is that so?",
"He was geeking out over those stories. He told me how proud he was to serve the Spanish crown!",
"...",
"Please, Señor. Rocoso Balboa indulged one glass in honour of his country. It was me, who persuaded him to keep going. This honourable man shouldn't be punished for my monkeyshines!",
"Are you trying to soften this old heart of mine?",
"I must say, for a girl with nonsense between the ears you speak quite plausible. Very well then. Balboa won't be hanging yet. I will give him one last chance, and you will see that I am myself very much an honourable man.",
"Thank you so much, Señor! I know he will never disappoint you again!",
"Now, if you please leave my quarters.",
"Goodbye, Captain Torres.", //18
"You, stop, in the name of the Spanish treasure fleet! Didn't I just see you talk to my navigator, Rocoso Balboa?",
"I'm sorry, I don't know who you mean. I've been here all by myself!",
"Well, there seems to be nobody else around... But I'm not entirely convinced yet! I've heard a rumour that this officer, Balboa, has been drinking heavily at the tavern. If that is the case, he must be caught in the act and punished accordingly!",
"I don't know anything about all that. Anything else I can help you with?",
"No. A few of my men will guard the road to the dock, in case he is trying to sneak back onboard undetected. That should suffice, I have to take care of other things.",
"Good night, Señor.",
