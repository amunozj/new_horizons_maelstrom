"You little snotty-nosed brat! Leave her alone at once! Begone!",
"...",
"Enough! One more word and I'll make you chew this blade of mine! And if you think I'm not serious, then you have never seen me angry, you poor bastard. So why don't you take your scarecrow and your baboon and go back to the cave you crawled out from?",
"...",
"I'm sorry about that. Is everything okay?",
"Absolutely. I'm just a tad confused. What was that all about?",
"Ah, yes. You see, this little brat and his companions have been harassing people, especially strangers, as long as I remember knowing them. You wouldn't have been the first to get robbed at knifepoint in plain daylight. I try to stand up against them whenever I can.",
"Why doesn't anybody complain to the authorities then?",
"The authorities? Ha! Even if that boy's uncle wasn't captain of the guard, the lazy and corrupt soldiers wouldn't lift a finger! And the governor? He believes this affair to be way below his paygrade.",
"I see. In this case, I owe you my thanks. Won't you get into trouble now?",
"I don't care, to be frank. I don't have much to lose. Actually, I am trying to get away from this town anyway.",
"Hopefully you make it! I haven't even introduced myself, my name is Beatrice Devlin.",
"Pleased to meet you, I'm Lorena Lopez. Listen, why don't we continue our conversation at my place before that dreaded kid sends a guard after us with lies and distorted facts? Just follow me, I show you the way.",
"Ha ha, I've heard that before. But don't worry, I trust you. Lead the way.", //13
"Here we can talk in peace.",
"So what are you selling here, Lorena?",
"Old stuff from my father's estate, mostly. As I said, I am trying to get away from here and I want to sell as much of this junk as I can before I leave\nUntil now, the business is not exactly going that well, but so be it. So, if you find anything useful lying around, please take it as my gift.",
"That's nice of you. Where did all your father's stuff come from, I wonder?",
"Mostly from his sea travels when he was young. The rest is from the plantation. My father owned some land near #sSanto Domingo# to plant sugar cane, and this is where I grew up\nHe passed away a couple of years ago, and I've been running the plantation since then. But I'm slowly getting tired of all this colonial business. That is why I decided to sell everything and try to start from scratch.",
"Where do you want to go?",
"I don't know yet. To the European homeland, perhaps. I've only heard stories, but I've never even been to Spain... But enough of all this. What about you, what are you doing in #sSanto Domingo#?",
"This might sound odd, but I have this strange name here written on this even stranger map. 'Marcel Jauri'. I'm trying to find him, but so far, my search has only led me to almost getting mugged.",
"It's a big town, Beatrice. Not everyone knows everyone. But I know him. In fact, he was the owner of this house we are standing in right know. He moved out when I moved in.",
"That's fantastic! Do you know where he moved to, perhaps?",
"Since then he has opened a tavern outside the town walls. I've never been there myself, but I've heard it is frequented by some very odd people. I can describe to you, how to get there\nGo through the town gates and follow the path. When you get to the tower, go straight ahead. At the next crossing, near the cliff, turn left.",
"That's very helpful, Lorena. I guess I won't lose any time and go find that tavern... Thanks again for all your help!",
"It's been a pleasure! Feel free to visit any time you want.",
"Take care!", //27
"Always nice to see you, Beatrice!",
"Likewise, Lorena!",
"I've been thinking. Since you want to get away from here, why don't you join me on my travels? I could need someone who knows how to manage trade and finances, and your background is perfect for this kind of task.",
"Are you serious about that? I would love to join you! I have already sold my land and it seems like I won't get rid of this junk here any time soon. Grab what you want, I'm ready to sail!",
"Perfect! Welcome aboard!",
