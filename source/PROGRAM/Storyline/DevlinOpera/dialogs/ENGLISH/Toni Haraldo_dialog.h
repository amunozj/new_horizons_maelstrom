"Today, I am the proudest father in the Kingdom of New Spain!",
"Yes, you certainly look happy.",
"Who are you to disturb an appointee of the Spanish crown?!",
"I'm here with the rum for your son's wedding, Señor.",
"Ah, finally! And just in time! The greatest of great days is today you must know. So... 40 barrels for the price of 20,000 was agreed?",
"I'm sorry, Señor, but there has been a problem with the cargo. I can only deliver 20 barrels.",
"What?! You dare to change the agreement? I won't pay you!",
"I'm terribly sorry. But you can just pay me 10,000.",
"Grr... My guests won't like this. They won't like this at all. They expect rum galore. But perhaps we could come to an agreement, if you do me a favour.",
"What kind of favour, Señor?",
"You look like an adventurous young woman. My guests would certainly enjoy your company. Attend the celebration in my chambers tonight and entertain my guests with stories of the high seas, and I will forget about everything. I will even pay you the full price.",
"I get paid to go to a party? Sounds like a plan to me!",
"You look like a strong man. There's a fight going on this afternoon, a fist fight, where bets are taken, and we are missing a combatant. So if you fill in, the two of us are good and I pay you the 20,000.",
"I get paid to beat people up? Well, I've definitely had dumber agreements!",
"This is where we usually meet for the fights.",
"At the beach? A slightly overdramatic setting for a brawl.",
"Well, we prefer some privacy since the Governor doesn't exactly value our noble sport very high... Anyway, here's the deal: You need to take a dive...",
"I'm not going to swim here, you idiot.",
"Listen, you amateur. Taking a dive means to lose the fight! You're going to battle first Cesar, then Chico over there. My attendants have put money on both of them emerging victorious, this means you fight back, but you don't punch too hard and then you take the hit and stay down.",
"I should lose the fight deliberately?",
"Señor! Do we have a deal or not?!",
"Sure we do, calm down old man.",
"Well then here comes Dirty Cesar!",
"I can hardly wait.",
"Very good! Now do the same thing again!",
"That hurt! This is bullsh...!",
"Don't be a wimp! Time for your second fight, here comes Chico!",
"Pff.",
"You idiot, you were supposed to go down, not make HIM go down!",
"My hand slipped!",
"Grr... You're ruining everything! Alright, here comes Chico. And this time... TAKE A DIVE!",
"We'll see!",
"What in Earth's name are you doing? I told you to TAKE A DIVE!",
"Excuse me, his face looked as if he wanted to get punched!",
"My audience is furious! They're going to murder you!",
"Let them come!",
"You killed all my visitors! You maniac!",
"One more or less doesn't make a big difference, you know?",
"No - Please! Spare me! You have already ruined my fights. Here, take the 20,000 for the rum you delivered!",
"And the betting money, right? That would be another 5,000.",
"You greedy pig! One day, we'll meet again!",
"Not today, old man. I'll leave this rock of an island immediately.",
"You look like a clever young woman. I've misplaced something and given today's wedding, I won't have time to search it myself. Perhaps you could look into it.",
"I'd need to know what I'm looking for... And where it was last seen.",
"It is... My collection of poems. Don't laugh! Reading them is very relaxing. I gave them to one of the guards, who was looking for reading material during his break. I think that's when I last saw them.",
"Where is this guard stationed?",
"No idea. You'd have to ask the head guard Crespo, he's responsible for the shifts. I think the man I gave my poems to is named Guzman.",
"Alright, I'll look into it.",
"Have you found my poems?",
"Not yet, Señor.",
"Señor - Through a string of unfortunate and curious events, your poems are currently in the possession of... your wife.",
"What?! My wife has my poems? Then why didn't she say anything? I've been looking for the poems everywhere! Unbelievable... WOMAN!",
"...",
"Have you got my poetry book? I've been looking for it all over the place!",
"I don't believe it - That book was already mine!",
"Excuse me, can I go now? I've been running around all day.",
"Yes, certainly. Here is the gold for the rum you've delivered. Now leave me alone, I have to sort things out here.",
"Pleasure doing business with you!",
