"And what do you want? Can't you see I'm trying to amuse myself?",
"I'm a woman who gets straight to the point, #sSenor#...",
"Rocoso Balboa, first Navigator on the 'Villa de Malaga'",
"...#sSenor# Balboa. You are in possession of a fragment of a treasure map, which you won in a game in #sGreenford#. I'd like to have it. How do we get into business?",
"You are very well informed, #sSenorita#...", //4
"Beatrice Devlin, Captain of the '",
"'.",
"...Captain Devlin. Your informations are correct. I don't know how you learned about it, but yes, I do possess such a document. And this may be generous, actually too generous of me, but it might be your lucky day.",
"How so?",
"Because all things considered, I don't have much use for this map. First: It's torn apart and incomplete, as you already know. Second: I'm an officer on a treasure ship, as you also know. This means I don't have the time, resources or the freedom in general to go treasure hunting on such a vague and fragmentary information. So yes, we might get into business.",
"Call the price then, #sSenor# Balboa.",
"A wise man would obviously demand a share of the treasure in the future. But I've got no guarantee here, I will probably never see you again and from all I know, such a treasure might even not exist at all. So if you want that piece of paper I've won from that drunkard in #sGreenford#, all I ask is a simple favour. Something, that's of use to me right now.",
"Speak out then, #sSenor# Balboa.",
"Our shore leave is almost over and I'm responsible for getting each and every man back to the ship in time. But there are five sailors still on the loose somewhere. I can't find them, and after all I want to finish this glass of wine in the time left. If you find all five missing sailors and send them back to the ship, you'll get your scrap of paper. They could be everywhere in the town or port area though.",
"This sounds easy enough. I will report to you as soon as I roped your men.",
"Can I get a description of the missing sailors?",
"Well, there's Juan, he's a boozer and rapscallion, I'm surprised he isn't here in the tavern. Jorge on the other hand is usually a fine man, duteous and god-fearing. Pedros is a seducer, a ladies' man. Ricardo loves adventure and the outdoors, he's an amateur botanist. And of course Paolo, the ship's carpenter.",
"Have you found all the sailors yet?",
"No, I'm working on it.", // 18
"All the sailors have been rounded up and sent back to the ship!",
"Excellent! Wherever the hell they may have been roving around... Anyway, you saved me a great deal of trouble.",
"Now don't forget we have a deal!",
"Right... The treasure map. Well, you'll see I'm a man who stands by his word! Here, take this slip of paper... I wish you good luck with it.",
"I'm sure I'll have that!",
"Hello! I'm Bonnie. Aren't you...?", //24
"Right! Well, as a matter of fact I am trying to amuse myself too! Do you mind if I join for a glass of that deliciously smelling wine?",
"Not at all, dear! As an officer, I don't want to join the ordinary sailors at the tavern. But the company of a lady is always welcome!",
"Innkeeper, I'll have what he has!",
"...you must know, Diego Velazquez de Cuellar came to the new world with Columbus. But he stayed to become a hero in his own right!",
"You mean when he became the founder of this town?",
"This is certainly a reason. In fact, every time we come to #sSantiago#, I feel like his presence is still lingering. Imagine: Fifty years ago, the whole island was wild and empty. It was Velazquez de Cuellar's expedition that defeated the Taíno, explored the land and built the first settlements. One of which soon grew into this beautiful town we see today!\nThus it is men like him, and their achievments, that make me proud of being a Spaniard and especially proud of serving the Spanish crown!",
"Does that include men like Hernan Cortes?", //31
"Cortes eventually became his own man too, but when the Spanish presence was established on #sisland_Cuba#, he was merely an aide to Velazquez de Cuellar. Cortes' expedition to the mainland is another topic, but tonight, it's the great conquistador and governor, Velazquez de Cuellar, I want to celebrate!",
"Let's raise our glasses then! To Diego Velazquez de Cuellar!",
"To him! And to the crown of Spain, and all the men who bravely serve it! To those, who give their blood and sweat in the conquest of the new world!",
"Cheers!",
"I usually don't d-drink... Hiccup! That much. But p-pssst it's a s-secret!", //36
"Who could resist this delicious wine?",
"You must know I won this t-treasure map here off a man who was c-considerably more drunk! But a part of the map is m-missing. It's as useless as a Portuguese sailor!",
"One last refill?",
"[SINGING:] ...but before you die my dear!...", //40
"[SINGING:] ...have a final glass of beer!...",
"Hiccup! Now I've had e-enough! Must go back to the s-s-ship. Help me... Hiccup! Find it. It's in the och-oshe-ocean!",
"I know where that is, I'll come along!",
"[SINGING:] Fifteen chests on a bottle of rum, Yo-Ho-Ho...! N-no, that's not how the song goes!", // 44
"Easy there, friend. Let me help you, you can barely walk, hi-hi!",
"T-t-thank you, you are very k-kind... M-might alchristy! That is my C-captain over there! He mustn't... Hiccup! See me like t-that!",
"Too late, he's coming this way!",
"Quick, get in there before he sees you!", //48
"I've made the worst mistake of my life! I never should have have been drinking! Not even a drop of wine!",
"Take it easy, my boy! We had a hell of a blast tonight, didn't we? Bringing some life to the tavern, bugging the guards, singing sea shanties... And to save the best for last: You won't even be punished!",
"I... I won't? But the law demands me to hang from the gallows of #sSantiago# any moment!",
"Let's just say I convinced Don Evaristo to give you another chance.",
"You did? Girl, you saved my life! And I mean that! How can I ever repay you?",
"Oh! Easy there, big man! You're crushing me.",
"Forgive me, I'm just so excited! A minute ago I was prepared to see my creator's face!\nYou know what? Take this. This paper was given to me by a drunk sailor in #sGreenford#, he claimed it to be part of a treasure map. Maybe it will lead you to an actual treasure. And if it doesn't, take it as a souvenir of saving a life!",
"That's very kind of you, friend. I will now you leave you in peace. You won't face your creator tomorrow, but you will certainly face a hangover, ha ha! [THINKS:] I've got the map! The others will be thrilled!",
"I have made the biggest mistake of my life! As soon as the Captain finds me, I'm going to hang!",
"He, who would have thought the shipyard offices are still open that late? The head-workman probably forgot to lock up.",
"Can't you see how desperate I am? I am shaking in my boots over here! I can't even feel that dreaded wine anymore, which I never should have touched in the first place!",
"Take a deep breath. All you have to do, is sneak back to the ship without anybody noticing! They can't prove that you have been drinking. As long as you're in your hammock next time anybody sees you, you are safe!",
"And how should I manage to do that? It's a long way down to the ship, and they are certainly looking for me all over the place!",
"You're right, your Captain said something about placing guards on the road. Wait in here, I'll go outside and see if I can find a safe way for you to get on board.",
"What am I going to do, what I am going to do...",
"You just stand still and wait for me!", // 64
"You are going to sneak back to your ship. Don't worry, the coast is clear. I have sent your crewmates on a wild goose chase.",
"You did? Thank you so much! You might have just saved my life, and I don't say that lightly.",
"Don't you lose any time, we don't know how long those watchdogs will be gone.",
"This is all a bit embarrassing for me, you know. You seeing me getting in that situation. Just remember that I am truly grateful\nYou know what? Take this. This paper was given to me by a drunk sailor in #sGreenford#, he claimed it to be part of a treasure map. Maybe it will lead you to an actual treasure. And if it doesn't, take it as a souvenir of saving a life!",
"Thank you for that, I'm most curious about it. [THINKS:] I did it! I have got the map! I can't wait to show Beatrice and Blaze!", // 69
"You are going to put on this cloak I have found! Come on, put it on!",
"Won't I look ridiculous in that thing?",
"Look, #sSenor#: First, I paid 25 pieces of eight for this, second, it is supposed to be really comfy, and third, it is the perfect disguise to sneak past those watchdogs your Captain put on the port road. So I am expecting a little bit more enthusiasm here.",
"Alright, alright. I guess I have nothing to lose.",
"Try it on!", // 74
"Well, how do I look?",
"Handsome and comfortable! Those watchdogs won't recognise you. Come on, let's get you to the ship!",
"It isn't even that comfortable, you know.",
"Psst! Keep quiet.", // 78
"Ha! The ruse worked! Those two have never been the brightest. All they can do is drink and seduce women!",
"Yes, that was surprisingly easy. Now you can sneak on board and pretend nothing ever happened.",
"I will do that immediately, but first, let me just say how grateful I am for you helping me out! The Captain would have slaughtered me!\nYou know what? Take this. This paper was given to me by a drunk sailor in #sGreenford#, he claimed it to be part of a treasure map. Maybe it will lead you to an actual treasure. And if it doesn't, take it as a souvenir of saving a life!",
"Balboa is the name, right? Remember me?",
"No, I don't. What is this? Are you looking for hire? In that case, you won't get far, I can guarantee you that.",
"Wrong answer, wimp. Try again. This time, take a good look at me first and think hard.",
"Wait a minute! #sGreenford#, right?",
"Took you long enough!",
"And what do you want?",
"What do you think? I want my rightful property back. Right now, if I may please.",
"Ha! You have got some nerves! You are an obviously unemployed Englishman, coming to New Spain. Drunk and barely standing straight, you start to talk an officer of the crown into a card game, offering nothing but a slip of paper you call 'your family's treasure map'. You try to cheat, you still lose\nAnd now you show up here in #sSantiago#, demanding that thing back? Ha! Your audacity almost impresses me! Now get out, before I call the guards!",
"Look, Mister, we can settle this the easy way or the hard way. Would you prefer an honourable duel to decide who gets the satisfaction... and the map?",
"A duel? Ehm... sure! Ehm... In the name of Spain will I defend my honour with this blade here!",
"Finally! Pay up and get out!", //92
"Well, ehm... I guess this place will do. Do you still want to do this? I mean...",
"Do you want to back out? Are you afraid already?",
"No, of course not! I just... Aaah, forget it! By Spain's might and in the name of ",
", I will teach you a lesson! You are going to yield, Devlin!",
"I can barely wait... Draw your sword, wimp!", // 97
"That's a big NOPE from me!",
"Hey! What do you think you're doing? Come back here! Coward! COWARD!!!", // 99
"You... You saved my life!",
"Not voluntarily. We are not done yet, Balboa!",
"Oh yes we are, please! Take your map. Here, take it. But don't hurt me! You were right, I am a coward. I'm the biggest coward in the treasure fleet! And I'm done fighting, and for that, I'm done pretending to be something I'm not!",
"I never believed for a second you were anything but a wretched coward, Balboa!",
"I know. I am no fighter. I'm afraid of swords, afraid of fighting. But I didn't dare to admit it, and was just hoping you would somehow let it be\nBut when I realised it was too late and the duel began, and then when those bandits appeared, I became so scared! You can think of me as a worm, and you would be right.\nBut please, let's just forget everything, you take the map and we go our separate ways. This is embarrassing for me, but I don't care. I just want to live!",
"Fine, you crybaby. Hand it over and get out of my sight this instant.",
"You make me sick, Balboa. You talk big, you speak your King's name, but you don't deserve to call yourself a man, you spineless worm. I am going to relieve this world of your miserable existence!",
