"Father!",
"...",
"Father, listen! There's a foreign ship near the island!",
"Oh, that's just my ship. I mean... my sister's ship.",
"She's sailing towards the coast, looks as if she wants to land in the bay!",
"Or is it my sister's ship? That one should already be in the bay.",
"And she's flying the colours of the corsairs!",
"That's definitely not my sister's ship.", // 7
"In the meantime, I will sneak back to the coast and observe what the pirate ship is up to.",
"Just be careful, girl. Your father can't afford to lose you.",
"Don't be silly, Mister. I will hide in the shrubs. The one advantage we have here is that I know the terrain and all its shortcuts better than anybody else!",
"Alright, then we will all meet back here after I talked to that governor.", // 11
"Father! Mister Blaze! The corsairs have landed in Punta el Ron. They sent a rowboat with a few men ashore, most probably to scout the area or even set up a camp already!",
"Is that the same bay where my... I mean, my sister's ship is anchored?",
"Not quite. But it's nearby. Too close for my taste. Have you got a plan? Any idea, what we could do?",
"Don't worry. In my experience, French pirates are pretty stupid by their nature. I bet I can make them leave the island with just a few simple tricks.",
"I've had enough dry land under my feet. I will get to the ship and let the cannons speak!", // 16
"Oh, would you really risk your life like that for us? If you're right and you can scare them away, Father and me would be in your debt forever!",
"No biggie. Do you have any idea where they might set up their camp?", // 18
"There's a small, abandoned fort, not too far from here. I heard it was built by Columbus' men on their fourth voyage to the new world, when they first discovered #sisland_Cayman#.",
"Then that's where I'm going to set up my ambush.",
"Can I come with you? I could help out!",
"Too dangerous. You stay here and look after your father.",
"*Sigh* If you say so.",
"Stay safe and don't leave the house. I'm going to warn my sister, she should move the ship away before the pirates take notice. After that, I'm going to play a little game with the corsairs!", // 24
"Alright. It might be dangerous, but if you insist...",
"Great! How do we start?",
"First, we're going to warn my sister, she should sail our ship away, before the pirates notice it. After that, we'll set up an ambush...",
"Yes? Shall I shoot something?",
"Not quite yet. Wait for my sign!", // 29
"What a fight, Mister Blaze! We sure showed them, didn't we?",
"Yes, and you fought well, Annie. But things are going to get a bit more complicated now. Thank you for the help, but now you must get back to your father to make sure he's safe. I'll take things from here.",
"Hm, if you say so. Good luck, we'll meet later at our house!",
"Goodbye, Annie.", // 33
"Wait! There's one more thing.",
"What is it, Annie?",
"Would you take me with you? I want to sail the seas and live a life of adventures!",
"Hm, but what about your father!", // 37
"Please, Mister Blaze!",
"Alright, I will introduce you to my sister. She's the one wearing the breeches. But now, we really should be going.",
"I'm sorry, but that's not a good idea.",
"Hm, that's a pity. Well, you will find me here should you ever change your mind.",
"Goodbye.",
"Great! Thank you so much!",
"Let's go!", // 44
"Alright, why not. Welcome aboard, Annie!", // 45
"A sea battle against pirates? If you could pull that off and defeat them or drive them away, Father and me would be in your debt forever!",
"No biggie. I'll just have to go and borrow my sister's ship.",
"Good luck and fair winds to you, Mister Blaze!",
"This won't take long!",
