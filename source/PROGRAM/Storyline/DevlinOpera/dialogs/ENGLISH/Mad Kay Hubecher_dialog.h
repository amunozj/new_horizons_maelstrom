"Mon Dieu! No wonder our scouts didn't return! This salaud must have killed them all! Les gars, grab him and we will take him to le Captain for punishment!",
"...",
"Look at this, le salaud has returned! Don't tell me you're a part of the crew now, murderer!",
"You're not that far off, actually. Your Captain promised me a passage off this island, if I do him a favour. But arriving here at the camp, I decided I can't go through with this scheme.",
"What in le Dieu's name are you talking about?",
"Your Captain asked me to to make sure you're still busy with the camp, while the rest of the crew prepares the ship. They want to set sail and leave you here. But I'm not that cruel, I just had to tell you!",
"What? He wants to leave us here? Just like that? Why would he want to do that?",
"'Less men aboard, a bigger share of the plunder for everyone.' Those were his words. Then he sent me ashore to keep an eye on you.",
"Bordel! To hell with this bastard! Men, let's go back to the shore, le Capitaine owes us an explanation!",
"No, think about it! If they see you on the shore, they'll set sail immediately!",
"Hmm, you may be right. But do you think we should just do nothing? Accept our fate?",
"You could lure the Captain into a trap, here on land. How about this: I convince him to come right here, into this fort. You and your men prepare an ambush. You get your revenge and then his place as Captain. And because I told you, you would take me off this island.",
"This may work. But how do you convince him to come here, right into this trap of ours?",
"I could just tell him you found a chest of gold buried in this camp. He would want to come and look for himself, wouldn't he?",
"I suppose so... That greedy bastard! Son of a cochon! Alright, we have a deal.",
"Then you just set up that little ambush and I will lead Captain Bonamy right here for you to attack. I won't be long! [THINKS:] Are they all really that stupid?",
"What are you waiting for? Lead le Capitaine to this camp and we will ambush him!",
"Patience, my friend. I'm on my way.",
