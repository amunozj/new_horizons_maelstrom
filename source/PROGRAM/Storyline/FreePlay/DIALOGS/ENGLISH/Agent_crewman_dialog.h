"Nothing for now.",
"Yes, ",
". Take our ship back to ",
". Wait for me there. I have some work to do here and will need to make my own way back.",
"Who are you?",
"I'm ",
". Are you the captain who is taking me to ",
"?",
"That depends. How much will you pay me?",
"Pay you? I already paid your associate in the tavern!",
"You'll get ",
" gold, but only when we get to ",
" and I've been paid myself. I told your associate in the tavern that I couldn't afford what he wanted to charge, offered double upon arrival, and he agreed.",
"Correct. If you'd tried to offer me money here, I'd have known you were dodgy.",
"That's the first time I've known anyone in your line of business to take refusal to pay as a sign of good faith! Shall we be going?",
"Yes. I'm told you're in trouble here and I don't want to wait for the trouble to show up!\nBy the way, my navigator is sick. Since you know where we're going, you can guide us there.",
"Very well.",
"Alright, we're here. Now, where's the ",
" gold you owe me?",
"You'll need to be a little patient. Before I can pay you, I need to be paid myself.",
"Very well, but don't try to run off. I'll be following you until you pay up.",
"Fair enough.",
"I'm warning you - don't try to wriggle out of paying!",
"I'm not. I'm working on getting your money.",
"Well! I didn't know you were working for the ",
" government!",
"Don't worry, I'm not interested in your business. Here's your gold. Thanks for bringing me here. Goodbye.",
"Nice doing business with you! If you get into trouble again and I'm in the area, maybe I can get you out of it again.",
"Don't count on it. But I'll keep that in mind.",
"Hello! Care for a drink?",
"Thanks! I don't mind if I do.",
"I don't think I've seen you here before. Are you here on business?",
"Sort of. I'm looking for someone named ",
". Do you know where I can find ",
"?",
"Yes, that's the ",
" who just bought you a drink. What do you want with me?",
"A mutual acquaintance sent me. And our business would probably best be conducted away from other listeners.",
"Very well, go and rent a room from the tavern keeper. I'll join you there.",
"Alright, I'll see you ",
"upstairs.",
"downstairs.",
"It's safe to talk here. Now, who is this mutual acquaintance of ours?",
" told me to contact you.",
"I see. You have a ship, don't you?",
"Yes, the ",
".",
"Is she seaworthy?",
"Yes - oh, there was a problem with termites. But we got rid of them and repaired the damage.",
"Good. That confirms who you are.",
"And who are you really?",
"My real name is ",
".",
"Yes, that is what ",
" told me. He also told me that you would have instructions for me.",
"Yes, I do. I've managed to steal an important document, but I fear that the ",
"pirates",
"Americans",
" are onto me. So I'll need you to get me off this island. Where are you moored?",
"My ship is in port.",
"My ship is moored at ",
".",
"That's no good! They'll be watching for me trying to board a ship here. Move your ship somewhere else, then find me again ",
"downstairs.",
"upstairs.",
"Alright, I'll sail to another part of the island, then I'll walk back to town and find you.",
"Good. Then let's head for your ship.",
"Follow me!",
"Have you moved your ship away from this port?",
"No, it's still here. I'll go and sail to another part of the island now.",
"Yes, it's now at ",
".",
"We made it. Now I need you to take me to ",
". I'll hand over the stolen document there, and I'll be sure to mention your part in this.",
