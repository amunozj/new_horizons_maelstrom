"Good Day to you Captain",
"Good Day to you too, Sir",
"Captain, I am Midshipman James Norrington of the King's Ship Repulse, may I know to whom I am speaking,.... I have not seen you in these waters before?",
"Of course. I am a captain ",
". What are you doing here?",
"Captain, The Repulse took shelter here due to a mighty hurricane that came out of the blue. We had heard about pirate attacks in the area, so I have been tasked with obtaining intelligence in the matter.",
"Ha! I have been through some stormy waters myself just lately, and please, call me ",
", no need to be so formal, relax. I am in the process of sorting my ship out. Where are you from?",
"Thank you Cap.., I mean ", 
",... and I would be most pleased if you were to call me James. I was born in England of a modest family. Too many mouths to feed, so I decided to join the Navy to make my fortune, and hang some pirates!!",
"Ah! so pirates are an interest of yours. Where is the Repulse now? I didn't see her in the harbour.",
"Oh! she re-provisioned and continued her journey. She should be back within the month, at which time I must make my report on the pirate situation, but my information is somewhat lacking at the moment.",
"Well, I can provide some assistance there. There is a pirate settlement to the east of here, on Nevis. It is a very large place fully equipped to service even line ships.",
"Thanks ",
", that will add substance to my report.. I am off to walk the cliffs to see if I can spot any pirate vessels from there.",
"Well James, I've matters to attend, but I look forward our further meeting perhaps. Good fortune in your intelligence!",
"Hello again, ", 
"You swine ",
". I knew you weren't to be trusted.",
"Ah! But you can trust me to outwit you. As you can see I have captured your ship.",
"You overestimate yourself. I only made minimum fire in order not to damage the Dauntless. Otherwise I would have sunk you.",
"Well at least you can remember this as another day you almost captured Captain ",
"Bah! You are just a pirate, and the worst one I have ever seen at that!",
"Even so, I bested you. Anyway I must see to taking over the ship. You and your crew can swim ashore. It isn't too far. Good day to you.",
"I'll do that James. Stay safe. I'll see you again soon I'm sure.",
"Hello again... I thought you had things to do?",
"Captain, my ship got diverted here due to a very bad hurricane. I was left here while she continued her journey, tasked with gaining intelligence on pirate activity in the area. Then The French attacked, Captain.",
"So... how come you're still walking about? And call me ",
", we can dispense with the formalities, especially in these circumstances!",
"Thank you Cap.., I mean, ",
" and you may call me James. My ship was still at sea, so the French captured me as I had no way of escape. I have had to give my parole not to try to escape, in return the French let me wander about the town instead of sitting in a cell. I think, they think, I am too lowly a rank to be of any threat to them.",
"James, my ship is moored near here, when I have finished what I came to do you must slip away with me.",
"It seems we are indebted to you for your noble act. I would shake your hand sir.... Wait! ... what is that on your wrist? ... Well, well, the mark of a pirate. Had a brush with the East India Company did you? And from your tattoo I see you are ",
"CAPTAIN ",
" if you please, Sir.",
"I believe we've met before, but it seems you have turned pirate, but you don't even have a ship. Such a shame. You are without doubt, the worst pirate I have ever ever seen. Guards... Take him away and hang him high.", 
"Is that quite fair, after 'such a noble act'?",
"What a surprise! Look at who's here, Mr. ",
"It's CAPTAIN if you remember. I didn't believe that we'd meet again quite so soon Commodore.",
"Of course you didn't. I'm happy to note that Miss Swann is with you alive. Now, Captain, you will accompany these fine men to the helm and provide us with a bearing to Isla de Muerta. I want to eliminate the last real pirate threat in the Caribbean, the #scursed_ship#. Then you should contemplate all possible meanings of the phrase 'silent as the grave'. Do I make myself clear?",
"Inescapably clear.",
"At last! We have reached Isla de Muerta. However, I note The #scursed_ship# is too close to the Dauntless. I don't like this. Any attempt to storm the caves could turn into an ambush.",
"Not if you're the one doing the ambushing. I go in and get Barbossa to send his men out in their little boats, your mates blast them with your cannons.",
"Your idea seems too obvious.",
"That's why it will work!", 
"Very well, I will let you go. But, don't try changing sides!",
"[to Will] I thought we might have to endure some manner of ill-conceived escape attempt but not from you, Turner.",
"[Will] I must do what I must.",
"You forget your place, Turner",
"[Will] It's right here...between you and ",
"Well, ",
" It looks like your luck has finally run out.",
"Luck, Commodore? I think not. It's my skill as a CAPTAIN that gets me through.",
"Skill! Skill? ",
", You are without doubt, the worst pirate I have ever seen.",
"You have yet to see my true skills... [looks at Norrington's sword]",
"What the... Guards, Guards! Take him! Cut him down.",
"[Snatches Norrington's sword] Catch me if you can...",
"You cur! I will hunt you down and then we will see how good a pirate you really are.",
"Commodore, Just think of this as the day you almost caught Captain ",
"You are indeed correct ",
", I don't like pirates, and especially you. Now, I must ask you two 'gentlemen' to accompany me back to the ship. Miss Elizabeth, if you would care to take my arm.",
"Just when you think you might be getting some leverage... ",
" We meet yet again. How did you get past the French this time?",
"Let's just say I have my ways, but what of you? I see you are still free to move about.",
"Oh! Indeed and more than that. We have heard of an invasion force coming to relieve us. So I have organised a local militia in order that we may provide some assistance.",
"Well, that will be sooner rather than later. The Governor has been equipping the fleet and massing troops, but that's all I can say at the moment.",
"What! Then there is no time to be wasted. I must bid you farewell ",
". I have matters to attend too, and people to organise, we must be ready at a moment's notice.",
"Farewell, James, and good fortune. I know you will get your promotion out of this.",
"An alliance with PIRATES! You must be MAD man! Absolutely mad.",
"Captain, let me finish, please.",
"Finish, finish indeed! This is plain madness. Everyone knows we can't trust the pirates.",
"You can't trust pirates Captain, that much is true, but, there is one way we can trust them to do what we want.",
"Your Lordship I must protest! This would mean me sailing under a PIRATE flag!",
"Only for a short while Captain.",
"I cannot believe that I'm sailing as a pirate!",
"Relax Captain. Remember you are doing this for England.",
"You treacherous dog! You have swindled everybody! I cannot believe that I was made party to all this.",
"I see you have fully recovered from your fainting fit. Not a good example for an English officer to portray.",
"GOOD EXAMPLE! ... I was choking on your pious words... 'honest pirate' indeed! Look at you. You swindled the Governor out of 200,000 in gold and tricked the pirates into attacking the French.",
"Not so Captain, not so. It hasn't cost the Governor a penny more than I told him at the residence, and we knew the French would attack the pirates, eventually. I just forewarned them to give them the advantage. And you? You get to go back to the Governor having averted a major battle, and probably to a fat promotion as well. Everybody wins!",
"But... humph... er... You get 200,000 in gold.",
"A small price to pay for saving the colonies I think, and I do need a ship. As I said, 'Everybody wins'.",
"Hmmm... Get me back to my ship. I need to get off this pirate infested island.",
"As you wish Captain. Let's go.",
"I shall return to the Governor to make my report. Are you staying here or coming with me?",
"I shall stay here Captain Norrington. I don't think your report will portray me in a good light, and I need to get myself a ship.",
"Hmmm... Well, you did avert what could have been a disaster for us, so perhaps the less said regarding the details of the matter, the better. I will leave you a ships boat, just in case you need it.",
"Thank you Captain. Perhaps we shall meet again. Fighting the French perhaps. Goodbye, and don't forget to get well out to sea before you change flags. I'm afraid you must remain a pirate a little longer!",
"Don't rub it in. I will never live this down... being a pirate indeed!",
"Ha Ha! Worse things happen at sea you know!",
"You impudent dog! How DARE you!",
"What? You mean This?",
"My story... it's exactly the same as your story, just one chapter behind. I chased a man across the Seven Seas. The pursuit cost me my crew, my commission, and my life.",
"No, not anymore, weren't you listening? I nearly had you all, off Tripoli. I would have, if not for the... hurricane.. ",
"So do I make your crew, or not? So am I worthy to serve under Captain Jack Sparrow !? You haven't said where you're going. Somewhere nice!",
"Or should I just kill you now?!",
"You're hired.",
"Sorry. Old habits and all that.",
"Oh, please. The captain of the Flying Dutchman.",
"You look bloody awful.",
"You hired me. I can't help it if your standards are lax.",
"Fair enough.",
