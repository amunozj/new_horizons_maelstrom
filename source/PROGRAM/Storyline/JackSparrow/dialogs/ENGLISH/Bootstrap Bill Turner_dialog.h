"You'd better get going.",
"Yeah - I guess I don't really have a choice.",
"You're alive? You should count yourself blessed to survive such a tempest. I haven't seen a storm like that in all my years!",
"So, where am I?",
"#sDouwesen#. It would appear the sea brought you here.",
"Any sign of my ship and crew! Where are they?",
"No. You should thank your stars I was here to take you out of the water. If I were you, I'd head to the city. Your crew may already be there looking for you.",
"That's a good idea. Thanks.",
"REALLY DAVY JONES FROM HERE DOWN",
"You look like a drowned rat! But you're lucky to be alive... and even more lucky to have found me.",
"Who are you? Where am I?",
"I am Davy Jones, some say king of the sea, and you may be on #sOxbay# or #sDouwesen# whichever I prefer. Washed up like an empty cask of rum you were.",
"Well that's good news and bad news. I was on my way to be hung, so I am saved from that, but I have no ship, it was burnt and sunk. I don't know what to do next.",
"A sad tale indeed. Perhaps I may be of assistance... for a price.",
"Assistance I could use. But at what price, how much money do you want?",
"I have no need for money. I need you to sail with me. I am on a quest and am in need of a good crew and men like you.",
"I know I am in no position to bargain here, but, I am my own man, and I have matters to take care of so I don't think I could sign on with you Sir.",
"Listen to my terms. I will raise your ship and give you thirteen years to take care of your affairs. Then you will give me your soul and sail with me for one hundred years.",
"You will allow me thirteen years on my own with no interference?",
"That is my word. Decide now or I will leave you here... to an uncertain fate.",
"Very well, I accept your terms.",
"No, that is too high a cost. I will fend for myself and rely on lady fortune.",
"So be it... the lady you seek, and your officers are on Islle de Muelle waiting your arrival.",
"How do I get back to my ship?",
"Turn round and walk to the shore. You will find your boat waiting there, with shall we say, a skeleton crew. Ha! Ha! Ha!",
"Very well",
"Then our conversation ends here... you will now find out how much lady fortune thinks of you.",
"Goodbye.",
"Hello Captain. Barbossa really screwed you, didn't he? Took your ship and your treasure, though your better off without the treasure.",
"Bootstrap! What are you doing here?",
"I objected to Barbossa taking your ship and not sharing the treasure with you. He didn't like my challenging his authority, so he had me lashed to a cannon and thrown overboard.",
"If that's the case you'd be dead. So what are you doing here? But thanks for sticking up for me. You must have been the only one.",
"I was the only one, but you and me go back a'ways. Anyway, lying on the seabed I didn't know what to do. I couldn't die, so I called for Davy Jones, and he rescued me. I had to swear to join his crew and serve for 100 years, but he's given me five years to sort myself out before I have to join the ship, on condition I don't speak to my son again. He's in England so that is no hardship.",
"Ah! Now I understand. I'm in a similar situation myself. Davy does you a favour and you have to agree to serve him. But why didn't you drown?",
"Ah! Ya' see the treasure is cursed, so it is. You are doomed to walk the earth as long as you have it. You cannot die, taste food or drink. Barbossa has to get it all back, and then take it back to the Isla de Meurte and each man must pay with his blood. Trouble is there's some missing, and it has to be complete to lift the curse.",
"That sounds like something I sort of know about.",
"That's as may be. We didn't find out about the curse till two of the lads got into a fight. One killed the other, only he didn't die. We'd heard rumours of course, but we didn't believe them till then. So when we fell out, Barbossa had me lashed to a cannon and thrown overboard. He's now gone off sailing around trying to collect all the gold back from the crewmates, some had left when we made port on the way back. All I knows is, he wont be successful.",
"Why not?",
"I had a coin in my boot when they threw me overboard. I've sent it to my son, Will, in England. Barbossa will never find it there. That is my revenge for the treatment they dealt me",
"So what now? I need a ship, any suggestion?",
"Me? I'm just trying to think of a way to get out of the contract with Davy Jones. Your best bet will be to talk to some of the folk in here, to see if they know of a ship going cheap.",
"Hmm. I suppose I should start talking around, but this is a pirate island!",
"Hey! Having sailed with Barbossa and with that mark on your wrist, you're a pirate now. The word will have travelled fast. I don't think you'll get a good welcome anywhere else.",
"Alright, I don't seem to have much option. Thanks for your help.",
"Oh Captain ",
"! I am SO glad to have found you. I am in so much trouble, well, Will is. Well, I am too.",
"Whoa, calm down Bootstrap, furl your sails. Now slowly, what's the problem?",
"Oh Dear, where to start! Well Barbossa thinks he's found the last piece of the cursed treasure. He thinks the Governor Swann's daughter has it. But that can't be possible, because I sent it to my son, or so I thought. Well, I did, but he doesn't have it now. Seems he came from England to try to find me. His ship was attacked, and sunk, by pirates, and tragedy of tragedies, that was probably us on the #scursed_ship#. ",
"A bit jumbled Bootstrap, but I think I got that. And...?",
"Well, it seems Will had his coin with him, but lost it when he was rescued, the only survivor of the attack. I found out that it was Governor Swann's ship that rescued him when he came over with his daughter to take over as Governor of the islands. They, his daughter, it seems must have taken the coin from Will then.",
"So what has this to do with your son? It's the Governor's daughter Barbossa is after.",
"Yes, yes, I know, Barbossa captured the Governor's daughter, Elizabeth, and took her away on the #scursed_ship#. But, young Will is head over heels in love with her.",
"Ah! young love. I have the same problem myself with members of the opposite sex falling for me. Sad Bootstrap, but not the end of the world.",
"But you don't understand, the young fool, and a few of his friends, stole a navy ship to go looking for her. The stupid boy didn't know where he was going and got himself captured by pirates. They have brought him, and the ship here.",
"So why don't you go and ransom his freedom? Pirate to pirate, I'm sure you could make a deal.",
"No I can't do that. Part of my deal with Davy Jones was that I wouldn't talk to my son again, or Davy would kill him. Will you help me?",
"Ah! Now I see your problem. Let me see what I can do. I get on quite well with most of the folk here.",
"Thank you ",
", I will be forever in your debt.",
"Rest easy old friend. Leave the matter with me. You'd better get off now before word gets around that you are here. Goodbye for now.", 
"Oh, friend, I'm afraid I'm too busy to speak at the moment. I've got a new idea, and I'm a bit distracted.",
"Sounds good. Just be careful, and don't blow us all up.",
"Help me! Help me!",
"Hold on. I'm trying to!",
"Help me! Help me!",
"No thanks, I wouldn't risk my life for you.",
"Oh! Thank you, thank you so much, ",
", if it wasn't for you, those simpletons would've torn me to pieces.",
"You're welcome.",
"Excuse me, friend, but I have an experiment that needs my attention, so I must take leave of you now.\nDon't be upset. A couple of very nice people have joined me at my house. I think that you'll be pleased to talk to them.",
"Good, I'm interested to meet your guests.",
"I am glad to see you, where is ",
"Danielle",
"?",
"Hmm...I thought she was already here.",
"Oh no! What happened to you, ",
"? You are not yourself...look at your clothes, and those bruises, and you're all wet!",
"Let me catch my breath! Bring me some wine, I'm dying of thirst.",
"Here it is.",
"Is that it? If that's a yacht, then I'm a king! That's just a fishing boat!",
"That's all I can do for you, ",
", and don't be upset with me.",
"I'm sorry. I suppose I don't have a choice. I'll have to look for ",
"Danielle",
" with this tub.",
"Here's your wine. Now tell me what happened?",
"It's a long story. Is ",
"Danielle",
" here? I can't see her ship.",
"No, she hasn't come yet.",
"Blast! That girl can't stay in one place for more than a moment. As luck would have it, I've lost my ship!",
"Hmm...I have a small yacht. Maybe it can help you?",
"A yacht? You old fox, why didn't you tell me sooner?",
"Well, it's a very small yacht...",
"Show it to me.",
"No, she hasn't come yet.",
"Blast! That girl can't stay in one place for more than a moment. I'll need to find her.",
"What are you talking about? I owe you my life! May I know your name?",
"My name is ",
", I'm a captain.",
"How interesting! I've got a couple of inventions that may be installed on a ship.\nOh, why are we standing here? I'm so grateful to you for rescuing me...I insist on going to my house now, I want to repay your kindness. Come, come.",
"Fine, let's go and have a look at your home. Just don't do anything with my ship.",
"We need to get back to the ship. I fear the destruction of the temple may cause an earthquake, or even something worse! The Incans were experts at making elaborate traps.",
"Traps that can cause an earthquake? Sounds pretty far-fetched to me.",
"Yes, yes! All right, let's assume there won't be an earthquake - but the inscriptions on the walls of the temple do mention a severe penalty that will wipe those who commit sacrilege off the face of the Earth.",
"The temple falling down around our ears was pretty severe. That was probably the penalty. We should still try to look for the treasure.",
"Captain, no! No treasure on Earth is worth losing one's life!",
"Well, the ground seems to be a little unstable now, so perhaps we should leave and come back. If there's going to be a volcanic eruption, I don't want to be standing here when it happens.",
"Yes, I guess that's not such a bad idea...",
"She could have waited for the answer, at least.",
"Let's follow her example, ",
". I'll go to the right, and you, captain, will go straight. If you don't mind.",
"What's the difference!? Just try not to get lost.",
"I doubt it. The inscriptions say the trap is by the entrance to the sun god's alcove. It looks like this is where the labyrinth starts.",
"Labyrinth?",
"Yes, labyrinth. Didn't I mention it? In order to get to the treasures, you must go through the labyrinth. I suppose only one of these passageways will lead us to them.",
"I think the ones who created this temple had a fondness for jokes.",
"Be careful at the temple, my friends. It's written in the tablet that there is a trap at the entrance of the sun god's alcove.\nAlas, there's no explanation of how to disable the trap, but it's said you can find the instructions inside the temple.",
"Thanks for the warning. Have you already finished the translation?",
"Yes, but the papers are damp and wrinkled. I couldn't make out everything that was written. There was a part about the alcove and some god that is asleep now. I don't think you should pay much heed to this. It's sure to be a native fairytale.",
"Blast! Where are the treasures?",
"I suppose that the entrance to the treasury, or to be more precise, the burial vault, is in the alcove.",
"Go ahead then.",
"Wait, the thing is, you can only enter the temple when it is lit with sunlight! Some complex mechanism, I don't really know...",
"Is that so? We'll have to wait for the sun, then. I hope the rainy season doesn't start today.",
"If my memory hasn't failed me, we were going to the temple.",
"Ah, yes, that's right.",
"Oh, Captain ",
"! What are you doing here? Did they also put you in jail?",
"No, my friend, I came here to rescue you.",
"Rescue me? How? I don't think you'll be able to persuade the warden to free me without an order from the governor!",
"I've already talked him into it, ",
".",
"Is that really true? You are an amazing person, captain, but why did you come here to help me all of a sudden?",
"To be honest, I want you to do me a favor in return.",
"Hmm...I'm ready to do that captain, but maybe we can continue this conversation some other place?",
"Sure. Let's go to the lighthouse, and I'll tell you everything on the way there.",
"...Foolhardy and reckless! I can't even believe that people are capable of that...",
"Everyone has his own particular notion of fun.",
"So, you want me to translate the native text on this piece of paper? You're especially interested in the part that describes how to get inside the temple, am I right?",
"Yes. You said that you know the native language.",
"Yes, yes...I spent a lot of time studying the local aboriginal population...and, ",
", if you're setting out on an expedition in search of that temple, I'll sail with you!",
"...For what reason?",
"I know the reason why you are going there...but I assure you, I don't need that. I just want to be there to see everything and maybe make an outstanding discovery!",
"Hmmm...I don't want you to suffer the trials of the sea voyage...",
"That's nonsense! I swear, ",
", if you don't agree to take me with you, I won't translate a single word of this text!",
"Then, it's settled. I'll take you with us.",
"Excellent! I'm so grateful to you! As to the translation, I need some time. I think it will take me a couple of days. The dialect is fairly unusual.",
"We'll repair the ship and prepare for sail.",
"Ah, it's you, captain! I've almost finished the translation. I need one more week and I'll be done.",
"We can't wait. Why don't you continue translating during the voyage?",
"Yes, that's a good idea, why not? will I get a headache when I am sailing? I guess not.... Do I get sea-sick? No, I don't think so.... All right, I agree. But, now I'm curious...what's the hurry?",
"I suppose the battle in the harbor went unnoticed, so perhaps I should explain...",
"A battle? What battle? In which harbor?",
"...Governor Silehard is not going to make us a present of the colony...and I suspect he plans to hang us at the first opportunity.",
"Hang? Ah, I see. I'll continue my work during the voyage. I must say that we got lucky, setting off at this time. It's said it's possible to enter the bay of #sKhael Roa# only twice a year.",
"Why can't ships approach the island at any other time?",
"According to the text it's a natural phenomenon that affects the tides.",
"That's probably why ",
"Raoul Rheims",
"couldn't get to the temple.",
"Maybe. But, it also mentions other perils. Perils that await those who seek the heart of the sun god's temple.",
"Keep reading. You'll have the next few days to investigate everything. Let's get to the ship.",
"By the way, captain, I'll need a stateroom, and it would be nice if it's somewhere near the stern so that the cries of the crew don't distract me from my work on the translation.",
"Hmm. All right. You'll have a stateroom.",
"Don't hurry, my friends. We are standing on the threshold. Somewhere around here should be the secret entrance to the burial chamber.",
"Do you think we should start tapping the walls?",
"Not at all. These pictures on the walls should tell us how to find the burial chamber's entrance and warn us of possible traps.",
"Aren't all the dangers behind us now?",
"No, I doubt it. The native engineers did their best to protect their temple. I am sure there are many dangers waiting for us.\nWell, we'll see soon enough. Now, let me think for a minute.",
"Yes, please.",
"Oh, no! Don't touch!",
"What's the matter?",
"This is a trap.... Oh no! You've already touched the stone!",
"Oh no! Tell me what happened?",
"This is the final trap left by the creators of the temple! Why didn't you wait! I could've read the inscriptions to find out how to avoid it, but no, you had to touch something!",
"If that's a trap, why we are still alive?",
"If we wait any longer, we'll be dead for sure! The trap opens a channel that brings water from the mountain lake to the caves under the temple. \nThe volcano's hot chamber sitting under the temple is still active, so can you imagine what's going to happen when that water hits the burning hot lava!",
"Hmmm. Will it be...? You think it might get a little stuffy in here?",
"Stuffy? The steam will blow up the temple! We must leave!",
"What about the treasure?",
"Forget the treasure! I've got to get out of here!",
"Isn't there a way? ...",
"Take me back home, Captain. Please? I'm afraid this is far more adventure than I need, at my age.",
"You're right, let's set sail.",
"Please, Captain! We have to leave!",
"All right!",
"Well Captain, that certainly was an adventure!",
"That's true, Bootstrap. I'm glad we all made it safely through.",
"Terrible that we can't get back into the temple to study more about those lost people.",
"I'm sorry we couldn't stay to find the gold, if there was any.",
"Oh I think there is gold there, Captain, it's just a matter of figuring out a way to get it....Hmmm...",
"Bootstrap, if anyone can do it, you can. Thanks again for your help.",
"...",
"Bootstrap?",
"Sorry to interupt you Captain, but I couldn't help overhearing what you were saying in there, and I think I can help.",
"Really, it's rude to eavesdrop you know! Anyway, who are you and how can you help?",
"My name is William Turner. People call me Bootstrap Bill. I overheard which town your Miss Brinkley is sailing to.",
"Ah! In that case I might overlook your little indiscretion. Which town is it then, and on what island?",
"I have a condition first Captain. I am in need of a position aboard a good ship. Will you take me on as your officer?",
"Well, despite your boots, you look able enough. Very well then, you're hired. Now where is it we must go?",
"Thank you Captain, you won't regret it. We need to go to the pirate encampment on Nevis.",
"Ah! Good! We will sort ourselves out, then set sail.",
"Captain, I don't think it would be a good idea for us all to go into town together. We will attract too much attention.",
"You're right, Bootstrap. You two go on ahead and ask around to see what you can find out. I need to get the ship reprovisioned anyway. We will meet in the Tavern later.",
"Captain! It seems that Brinkley is here, but not in the encampment. We need to find a diamond smuggler named Eastwood, he has a place somewhere in the jungle. She is supposedly working with him.",
"Good work, Bootstrap. Let's go and find him then.",
"That's her! That's the Brinkley woman. She's been killed!",
"Well, she certain doesn't look like she's going anywhere. We need to talk to Eastwood again.",
"Captain, I am afraid I must leave you. I've just seen Captain Barbossa over there and his ship, I know, goes to England. I really want to get back there. So, with your permission...",
"Of course, Bootstrap. Perhaps we will meet again one day. Good luck.", 
"Time's run out, Jack.",
"Bootstrap? Bill Turner??", 
"Jack Sparrow. You look good.",
"Is this a dream? ", 
"No.",
"I thought not. If it were, there'd be rum.", 
"You got the Pearl back, I see. [Bootstrap hands a bottle of rum]",
"I had some help retrieving the Pearl, by the way... Your son.", 
"William? He ended up a pirate, after all.",
"Given a liberal definition of the word 'pirate.' He's got an unhealthy streak of honest to him.[Takes a drink from the bottle]", 
"That's something, then. Though no credit to me.",
"And to what do I owe the pleasure of your carbuncle?", 
"Davy Jones. He sent me as an emissary.",
"Ah, it's you, then. He shanghaied you into service, then.", 
"I chose it. I'm sorry for the part I played in mutiny'ng against you, Jack. Everything went wrong after that. I ended up cursed, doomed to the depths of the ocean, the weight of the water crushing down on me. Unable to move ... unable to die. All I could do was think. And mostly I thought, even the tiniest hope of escaping this fate ... I would take it. Trade anything for it. It did. Davy Jones came. Made the offer. I could spend one hundred years before the mast, with the hope that after, I would go on to a peaceful rest.",
"Funny what a man'll do to forestall his final judgment.",
"You made a deal with him, too, Jack. He raised the Pearl from the depths for you, and thirteen years you've been her Captain. ",
"Technically the Flying Dutchman already has a captain, so there's no need for me... ",
"Then it's the Locker for you! Jones' leviathan will find you and drag the Pearl back to the depths, and you along with it! You won't be able to talk your way out of this!",
"Any idea on when Jones will release said terrible beastie?",
"I told you, Jack: your time is up! It's not a matter of how long 'til it comes after you - it's a matter of how long 'til you're found.",
"!!!",
