"Are you looking for work captain?",
"I could be. What do you have in mind? And, who might you be?",
"My apologies....Let me introduce myself. I am Sir Cutler Beckett of the East India Trading Company. At your service. And you are?",
"I am Captain ",
". So what is this work you mentioned?",
"I am currently looking for captains to serve with the East India Company. How would you like a position as one of its Captains?",
"It sounds very intriguing Sir Cutler, and what exactly would that entail? And more importantly, what would it pay?",
"Straight to the point, as I have heard, Captain. The payment is initially 5,000 gold pieces per run.", 
"A fair price. So what constitutes 'a run'?",
"Carrying various cargo from one island to another. Straightforward really. I need honest and reliable men, and they are hard to find in these pirate infested waters.",
"And escort ships?",
"That is how you will earn your money. You must be prepared to defend yourself, your ship and, of course the cargo. The Company does not provide escort ships. However, as you prove yourself, you will be given one of the Company's own ships. A considerable investment on our part I might add. Well, Captain ",
". Are you interested?",
"Yes Sir Cutler I am. When do I start? [THINKS: It won't take me long to get a Company ship. I am after all, Captain ",
"].",
"No time like the present captain. Here is 5,000 in coin which you may use to refurbish your ship, and a further 5,000 which you should use to purchase as much cargo as your ship will carry. That cargo should be sold where ever you determine and the monies delivered to me at the Company's offices, which you will find in #sRedmond# on #sisland_Redmond#. Trade as you see fit, it is the return on my investment that I wish to see. Obviously you will use you skills to determine the best return on that investment.", 
"Buy cargo, or whatever, get the best price for it, and deliver the monies to you at the Company office in #sisland_Redmond#. Got it Sir Cutler. I will see you soon.",
"Good, we have a contract. I have invested 10,000 in you captain. Let's see how much you can return to me in #sRedmond#. You will be judged on your performance, and your reward will be commiserate with that performance. The better you perform, the greater the reward.",
"I understand Sir Cutler. You are looking for a return on your investment.",
"Good. I will see you in #sRedmond#. A final point captain. Should you turn out to be a pirate and renege on this contract. My retribution will be severe. Do you understand?",
"I understand that too, Sir Cutler. You can rest assured, I am no pirate. I am an honest captain, out to make my own way in the Caribbean.",
"Then good day to you Captain. Till we meet again, I bid you a fair and following wind.",
"Good day to you too, sir.",
"No Sir Cutler. I'm afraid I do not wish to commit myself to one employer at the moment, so I will bid you good day.",
"As you wish captain. Perhaps we shall meet again, and perhaps, you may have a different view of things then. Good day to you sir.",
"One can never know what the tide may bring in. Good day to you too, sir.",
"Are you ",
" by chance?",
"It's CAPTAIN ",
" actually. But you have the advantage of me. Pray sir who are you? I do not believe we have met before?",
"My apologies, Captain. Let me introduce myself. I am Sir Cutler Beckett of the East India Trading Company. At your service.",
"Indeed? And what would a noble man, such as yourself, be doing in a tavern? And why would you seek me out?",
"Relax, my dear Captain. I am in need of immediate escort to #sRedmond# on #sisland_Redmond#, and you have come very highly recommended. I am advised there are pirates in these waters. My own escort ship was called away on urgent business and I have a valuable cargo to transport, so I find myself temporarily embarrassed in this matter.",
"That is very flattering Sir Cutler, but I am very busy at the moment. [THINKS: A bit of leverage there to get the price up.]",
"Would 5,000 in gold ease your work load? A good profit for a quick run to #sisland_Redmond#, I think.",
"Ah! 5,000 in gold you say?",
"Payable upon our safe arrival.", 
"Very well Sir Cutler, I will do it. [THINKS: I think I drew that out well. 5,000 in gold! A tidy sum.]",
"An excellent decision captain. When do we sail?", 
"I have a few things to attend to. But we will leave shortly. I will meet you in port.",
"All things considered, a successful journey Captain. I must attend to the unloading of my cargo, so I will move my ship to the Company's dock. I will meet you shortly in the Company's apartments when I will make your payment. They are located in the large building to the right of the gate as you enter the town.",
"Yes Sir Cutler.",
". To the matter at hand. Here is the payment for the escort you performed so well.",
".",
"Ah! Captain ",
" You have finally arrived. You have travelled without incident I trust?",
"Just the usual seafaring stuff Sir Cutler.",
"You have proved yourself an able captain. How would you feel about working further with the Company?",
"I'm always ready for business Sir Cutler!",
"No Sir Cutler. I think I would prefer to follow my own fortune for now.",
"Good man. Here is 10,000 in gold. Go trade, barter or whatever you see fit, and make a profit for the Company. When you have completed the task, return here, and we will discuss your future further.",
"Might there be a time limit for the task at hand?",
"No captain, as you see fit. When you think you have enough profit, just return here. However, you should know that I am not known for my patience. So do not return here unless you are ready for the reckoning.",
"Yes Sir Cutler. I understand. I will go now, and make a start.",
"Good. Good day to you then captain.. and good fortune.",
"Good day to you Sir Cutler.",
"And how fared your mission? Successful I trust.",
"I believe so Sir Cutler. Here is the money.",
"I understand. Is that all Sir Cutler?",
"Good, see that you do. I am not known for my patience... remember, in the meantime you are on borrowed time, and we shall be watching, to ensure your efforts are the most diligent in the matter!",
"Yes, Sir, I know what I must do.",
"Thank you Sir Cutler. What ship would that be?",
"Excellent! Excellent! You have more than doubled the Company's investment in you. You are indeed an asset to the Company. You need no further training and are ready for a Company ship.", 
"Ah! Payment, yes Sir Cutler, thank you.",
"Are you ready to get underway for #sisland_Antigua#?",
"Well, yes Sir Cutler, I am anxious to start earning real money. I do need to reprovision my ship, amongst other things, first though before I set sail.",
"That's settled then. Here is the your payment for this trip.",
"Are you ",
" by chance?",
"Relax, my dear Captain. You have come very highly recommended and are just the sort of captain the Company is looking for.",
"That is very flattering Sir Cutler, but I am very busy at the moment. [THINKS: A bit of leverage there to get the price up.]",
"",
"You will need to get your ship reprovisioned. A task of an urgent nature needs your attention.",
"A good result captain. A fifty percent profit will suit the Company. You may keep the rest. One more mission and you will be given a Company ship.",
"What mission would that be Sir Cutler? I am anxious to get a Company ship.",
"For a captain of your quality, a simple one. One of my officers has been captured by the Spanish. I need you to rescue him.",
"Where might he be?",
"He is on #sisland_Isla Muelle#. The problem is however, we don't know where on the island. Do you think you can accomplish his rescue?",
"Yes, Sir Cutler, I understand completely.",
". I can handle anything.",
"Good man. Complete this mission successfully, and you shall have your ship. I will give you 5,000 in gold to fund the endeavour. I wish you good speed captain. Good day.",
"Yes Captain ",
". Simpkins will provide you with a Company uniform as you leave. As of now you are an acting Lieutenant with the Company. That is all. A fair and following wind to you.",
"Good day to you, Sir Cutler. Goodbye.",
"", 
"Captain ",
"Not what I expected captain. The Company expects more than this level of return. I am afraid you must repeat the mission. Hopefully you will do better this time.",
".",
"Very well Captain, there is no more to be said on the matter. A fair and following wind to you.",
"Excellent Captain! Here is 25,000 in gold. Consider it, shall we say, an advance. Re-fit and reprovision as soon as you can then set sail for #sisland_Antigua#. You will be given goods there which you should take and sell on another island for the best price. Buy gold with the money you get and then return here. These papers will ensure your safe passage.",
"",
"",
"",
"You have rescued Wanderman! An excellent result Captain. I shall have no hesitation in giving you a Company ship and 10,000 in gold.",
"A successful journey Captain. I have immediate business, to which I must attend. I will meet you later in the Company's apartments when I will make your payment. They are located in the large building to the right of the gate as you enter the town.",
"Now Captain, are you interested in sailing one of our ships for a special cargo? It will be very profitable for you.",
"You shall be given command of a Company ship, The Wicked Wench. The Company will of course keep your ship till you return.",
"Yes, Sir Cutler.",
"I need you to sail to Muscetto Cove on #sisland_Antigua# and pick up a very special cargo. Speak to no one about the matter. I will pay you 5,000 now and 5,000 when you return and deliver the cargo to the far shore on #sRedmond#. I will be there to meet you. These papers will ensure your safe passage.",
"Is this it? I could have got a better return with the money lender.",
"",
".",
"You are without doubt the worst Captain I have ever met. Get out! I want no further dealings with you.",
"Er... well, I thought it would be enough.",
"So, we meet again ",
". I trust you have my money?",
"Then hand it over ",
"er... Goodbye... Sir Cutler",
"Here it is.",
"Yes Sir, I understand. Regarding selling the goods on my return. Can I sell them at any island?",
"Oh! the just usual seafaring events!",
"Yes, yes! The problems of the sea. You have the gold I trust, and anything else?",
" And the Victualler did give me a packet of documents for you.",
"We shall count that as two trips, #sisland_Antigua# and Bridgeford, so that will be double the amount! But first, the packet, if you please.",
"I need you to collect another packet. This time from the shipyard owner in #sOxbay# Town.",
"Very well, Captain, Very well. Make all speed on this trip, the matter is of the utmost urgency. I shall pay you 6,000 in gold in advance to hasten your return.",
"The Governor has tasked me with sinking a French supply ship at Falise de Fluer, M'lord",
"Very interesting, very interesting! While there perhaps you will collect a packet for me from the shipyard owner. I will pay you 6,000 in gold in advance",
"I need you to prepare to sail to #sSt John's# on #sisland_Antigua# to load with goods. Then you should sell them and buy gold which you should deliver to me here.",
"Your name and ship prisoner, and be quick about it!",
" And I would like to know why I have been wrongfully imprisoned?",
"I only know of you. We have never met before. Consider yourself lucky to be alive ",
"... At least for the moment! I am Sir Cutler Beckett of the Honourable East India Trading Company, and also currently acting Governor of this fair island.",
"I know that... I'm working for you! ... Don't you recognise me? Take me to the Governor at once!",
"You would do well to keep a civil tongue in your head ",
" It is only the fact that the Governor knows of you and has spoken well of you, that you are still alive. The Governor has left the island for the time being, so explain yourself to me. NOW!",
"I am working for... er... you... well, now I look closer, maybe someone who looks a lot like you... er...",
"This makes no sense! ... Guard! ... Guard! Bring the prisoner to the Residence. We shall get to the bottom of this matter yet! .",
"Now ",
", Explain yourself before my patience gets shorter, and your neck gets longer.",
"I have been working with the Governor to free #sOxbay#... and with the man called Beckett for the East India Trading Company. I have the Company's papers to prove it.",
"The Governor has spoken well of you, and your efforts on behalf of the Crown, which is to your advantage. As to the papers, I have examined them and they are real. So I am wondering how they were come by. That brings us to 'your' Beckett... Where did you meet with him?",
"Here, in the Tavern.",
"In the Tavern, SIR CUTLER! Mind how you address me,... and pray, what was the nature of your business with him?",
"Sorry, Sir Cutler. I would sail to various places, #sisland_Antigua#, #sOxbay#, #sGreenford#, purchase gold and bring it back here.",
"Back here? And where 'back here' was this business conducted?",
"er... in the Tavern... er Sir Cutler.",
"The Tavern! The TAVERN! Did it not strike you as peculiar... that an Officer of the Honourable East India Trading Company would do business in the the TAVERN?",
"Well... now that you put it that way... I suppose... Sir Cutler.",
"Suppose! ... Perhaps, ",
", you would have done well to have 'supposed' earlier when you were doing business in the Tavern! ... Describe the man.",
"Well, he does look a lot like you, Sir.",
"Indeed. That I suppose excludes ninety-nine percent of the population of these islands... what else?",
"He did keep repeating his first words when he spoke.",
"Har! Indeed he did? Interesting! You will find this man and bring him back here, alive. We will see if he is an imposter, or,..... someone else. While you are doing that I have another task that you will also complete for me.",
"How about maintaining the length of your neck to its present dimension?",
"Ah! ... yes, Sir Cutler, that will do nicely.",
"You are starting to see sense, your current position is tenuous. Only the Governors recommendation has kept you alive to this point. Perform these tasks well and you may redeem yourself somewhat with me. Otherwise I will brand you as a pirate, then hang you.",
"Sail to the pirate encampment where you should find a man called Raoul Rheims. It was he who betrayed #sOxbay# to the French. Capture him and bring him back here.... and while you are about it keep a weather eye out for 'your' man Beckett. If you catch hime bring him back here alive also. Here are your Company papers and your effects. Now get yourself off and make all haste with this mission.",
"Jump to it man!! Don't just stand there. You have things to do!",
"My name is ",
", and I'm captain of the ",
".",
" This is ridiculous... you know who I am!",
"And... what about payment Sir Cutler?",
"Captain, there don't appear to be very many boxes being carried by. I trust you are not trying to defraud me. That would be most unwise! most unwise! I will pay you this time, but at a reduced amount. I need you to prepare to sail to #sSt John's# on #sisland_Antigua# to load with goods. Then you should sell them and buy gold which you should deliver to me here. But, Captain... Heed my warning! ",
"I assure you, Sir Cutler, that is not my intention. I just have this invasion business on my mind, that's all. Thank you for the payment.",
"I have spoken with the Governor and he has given me a task of the most important nature on #sFalaise de Fleur#. I cannot refuse.",
" Where are the prisonsers Rheims and 'your' mystery man?",
"I could not locate them Sir Cutler. I tried several islands but no sign of them, except this journal belonging to Rheims. It shows he is planning some sort of mission.",
", I thought you thought, you were better than that. It seems I must content myself with disappointment at your failure. However, being the generous man that I am, I will pay you the 5,000 gold I promised, plus a further 5,000, but you will use it to fund another task I have for you. And this time do not fail!",
"A ship was captured by pirates several days ago, '",
"pirate captain 06",
", headed for Europe from New Light. As it was passing by our colony, pirates struck. \nBesides the usual trade goods, there were several golden idols on board. These are rare Aztec treasures that I have ordered for my collection. \nI have discovered that the pirate lord that ordered the capture is ", 
"Alistair Garcilaso", 
"Alistair Garcilaso",
". He and his gang of butchers are hiding in the #sDouwesen# jungle, I don't know where exactly. \nYou, ",
", will find them and bring my collection back somehow. \nI will give you a further 10000 when the mission is completed successfully. \nDo you understand?",
"Very well, be on your way. And remember,... \ndo not fail me in this mission. Your future... shall we say... hangs on it's success!", 
" You are dismissed.",
", I was just on my way way to the docks. I am told there is a lot of activity unloading your ship. Does this mean you have recovered my collection?",
"This is most agreeable news Captain. You have indeed saved me months of work and I shall show you my appreciation.",
"Well... your Sir Cutler, I must confess that one box was empty, so I assume one idol is missing. I could continue searching for it if you wish.",
"No, No. That will not be necessary. You have proved yourself and I have a most important task for you in the near future. In the meantime, to your reward. Firstly, the 10,000 in gold I promised, secondly I am giving you the 'Wicked Wench'. A fine ship indeed, she will serve you well.",
"That is very generous Sir Cutler. Very generous. But, what of the task you have in mind?",
"Not yet Captain. You will need to get used to your new ship, put her through her paces and see how she handles. I want you to sail to #sGreenford# and collect a prisoner from the Prison Commandant and bring him back here. This is your letter of authority. When you return you will be ready to take on the main mission.",
"Good. Then sail as soon as you have reprovisioned. I am off to examine my new collection. I will see you on your return.",
". It is good to see you again. Good to see you. Even in these unfortunate circumstances.",
"Sir Cuthbert! What are you doing here?",
"I was the prisoner you were sent to collect! My 'dear' brother is getting closer to catching me by the minute. \n Fortunately for me I still have friends, and they helped me escape. I am hoping that you will be prepared to help me as well.",
"I will help you if I can your Sir Cuthbert. What is it you need?",
"What ships are in Lighthouse Bay? English warships, or anything friendly?",
"Well I just met Barbossa and Danielle down there. They seem to have infomation on Rheims, and they do have a ship. But there is an English patrol in the area.",
"Rheims Eh? Well, that will interest my brother. You had better go back and report to him. I'd like to see his face when he finds out I have escaped, but be sure not to tell him that you know I was the prisoner. Do you have any other news?",
"Of course I won't mention I found out who the prisoner was. As to other news, I think Barbossa may be able to help me find the Cortez treasure.",
"Good, good. Keep me informed on that venture. I am most interested to help, most interested. I will take my leave for now and see if I can join ship with your friends. I will find you again soon.",
"Goodbye Sir Cuthbert, and take care.",
", you have the prisoner in chains I trust?",
"No Sir Cutler,... I regret to say that the Prison Commander let him escape. They are still searching for him though.",
"Bah! The incompetent fool... I will deal with him later.",
"I do have some good news, Sir Cutler. I have found a trace of the traitor Raol Rheims. I could go after him if you wish.",
"Yes, you should do that. But first, ",
", I have a task of a more important nature for you that you should carry out first.",
"This is the task we spoke about before Sir Cutler.?",
"Yes it is. I need you to sail to Muscetto Cove on #sisland_Antigua# and pick up a very special cargo. Speak to no one about the matter. This is most important so I will pay you 50,000 now and 50,000 when you return.",
"Yes Sir Cutler.",
"You should deliver this cargo first. To the far shore on Jamaica, I will be there to meet you. Then you may continue the search for Rheims. The cargo is very large so make sure your hold is empty except for the provisions you will require for the trip. And remember speak to no one about it. Do you understand?",
"Good then make sail for #sisland_Antigua#, and the Cove as soon as you can. Here is your money to provision your ship, and make sure you land in daylight.",
"Thank you Sir Cutler. I will set sail as soon as my ship is ready.",
"What! Who! Oh! it's you, ",
". You dare to show you face here after betraying me and killing my men. You fool!!!",
"Not so much the fool. I caught you napping didn't I? ... And stand away from that fire, what are you doing?",
"Keeping my promise, ",
". I said I would brand you as a pirate, and I have kept the iron in the fire since your treacherous act on #sisland_Antigua#. Try THIS for size!!!",
" AHHHHHHHH! ... SWINE... you will pay dearly for that. Brand me a pirate would you? Prepare to die...",
"I think not! Guards, Guards! Take these fools.... we will hang them in the morning.",
"Not without a fight you won't.",
"You fool ",
", you should know better than to think you can escape from me.",
" How did you know I would be here?",
"Hmph! Insults coming from a ship thief! No matter, ",
", I have you now and this time you will not escape. To make sure of this, I have taken your ladyfriend into custody, and my men have burned your ship. She is sinking nicely don't you think? Now hand over the Cortez Map parts.",
"Beckett you dog... You will pay for this! In fact you already have... You see, the map parts were on board my ship, and you have destroyed them, along with the ship.",
"Ha! Ha! Ha! Such brave words. As I remember, you sewed them into your clothing. Don't forget, I have your ladyfriend and crew. If you don't want to see them all hung right now, you will board my men's ship and sail to Jamaica. We will see to the truth of the map when we get there.",
"It seems I have no choice at the moment. But my turn will come. You shouldn't forget either, I'm Captain Jack Sparrow!",
"Oh! Indeed it will... your turn to be hung that is! And I'll make sure to remember that it was 'Captain Jack Sparrow' hanging from the noose. Now get to the ship. Your ladyfriend's life depends on this.",
"Alright. [THINKS: I have to do something. I can't volunteer to be hanged like this. But Anamaria and the crew are imprisoned and I have nowhere to go. Better play along for now, I have to wait for the opportune moment. On to the dog's ship, it is.]",
", we meet again.",
"Sir Cutler...",
"Sir Cuthbert... Am I glad to see you. I now have three pieces of the Cortez Map.",
"We had a deal, ",
". I contracted you to deliver cargo on my behalf; you chose to liberate it.",
"People aren't 'cargo', mate. ... Wait a minute! ... My ship! ... On FIRE! ... WHY is my ship on fire?",
"That is the price you pay for breaking our contract. Part of the price, that is.",
"No, not my ship... Nhhh... What about my crew! You will burn them alive!",
"Oh No! Captain, your crew are safely aboard my ship. Under lock and key of course.",
"Beckett, you filthy, slimy, mangy cur!",
"Oh! this is rich and so funny! I destroy your ship, plus now I get the parts of the map you had, and you did all the work for me. Whether you wanted it or not. Oh! this is really rich!",
"But I wasn't your enemy, we COULD have come to some sort of a deal... And that is the Company's ship you're burning, isn't it?",
"Ah! The ship. I thought you just said it was your ship? Haha, I'm just making sure it doesn't end up in the wrong hands again. I was informed you would become a problem not long after I gave her to you, but I did let you play with her a little while longer.",
"While it suited your evil, greedy purposes. In all the history of lowly scums, you are the lowest of the low, Sir.",
"My men are indicating only a moderate quantity of gold has been delivered. Not the return on my investment that I was expecting, Captain. Not what I was expecting at all. Anyway, give me the package. Here is your money", 
"My men are indicating to me that there is little gold in the consignment. A very poor return on my investment, Captain. A very poor return indeed! Certainly not worthy of payment. Anyway, give me the package.",
"I have been working with you... er, well, with a man called Beckett for the East India Trading Company. I have the Company's papers to prove it.",
"The Governor knows of you and has spoken well of you, which is to your advantage. As to the papers, I have examined them and they are real. So I am wondering how they were come by. That brings us to 'your' Beckett... Where did you meet with him?",
", I am prepared to consider the past to be the past... IF you are prepared to serve this cause.",
"Ah! the cause. And what exactly is the cause? Sir Cutler.",
"As the Governor stated the French have decided to invade these islands with the help of the pirates. We must prevent this alliance from happening at all costs. Are you with us?",
"Yes, Sir Cutler. I am with you. What is your strategy in the matter?",
"No, Sir Cutler. I would prefer to follow my own course and therefore bid you adieu.",
"I regret Captain, that, that will not be possible. You know too much, and as you are not with us, and as a known pirate, you are now the enemy. Captain Norrington will you assist in what we must do?",
"[Norrington] Certainly Sir Cutler, it would be a pleasure... Draw your sword and prepare to meet your maker ", 
"The French, coming from Europe will have a natural line of approach from the north east, which as you know will bring them to #sisland_Turks# Island or #sTortuga#, both pirate islands, where they will need to replenish their supplies.",
"Yes, Sir Cutler, that would seem to be the most logical line of approach.",
"Indeed, indeed. Captain Norrington therefore, will position his fleet midway between #sisland_Turks# and #sTortuga#, so as not to be detected, and when we see which island the French ships are headed for, Norrington will strike, before they can reach land. They will be tired and weak from the long voyage and prove to be less of a fighting force, and when Norrington has defeated them, the pirates will not dare put to sea against us.",
"And my part in this venture? Sir Cutler.",
"Your part, ",
", is to sail out from the islands, spot the French fleet, determine which island they are headed for, and then advise Captain Norrington so he might attack with all speed.",
"I see, Sir Cutler. But, if I may be so bold, your plan has two major flaws.",
"FLAWS! FLAWS! You impudent dog! Explain yourself!",
"Yes, Sir Cutler. Firstly, there is too much traffic between #sisland_Turks# and #sTortuga# for the good Captain's fleet to remain undetected. Once seen, a pirate ship will sail off and advise the French fleet of its presence. If you are aware of the impending arrival of the French, you can be sure that the pirates are also aware.",
"Hmmm! And your second point Captain.",
"Secondly, the French have an experienced navy, Sir Cutler. They will not sail in with the whole fleet at one time. They will have a vanguard in advance of the main fleet. It is that, that Captain Norrington would attack, thereby giving his position away to the main French fleet, who would then have time to choose the order of battle.",
"Ah! Good points Captain. You have a better plan I assume?",
"Yes, Sir Cutler. We need to form an alliance with the pirates and turn them away from the French.", 
"Relax, my dear Captain. I am part of the Governor's party, the Governor is in need of time to talk with his daughters after their ordeal, so I stepped in here for a quiet libation. I have heard all about your dramatic rescue of his daughters, that is how I come to know about you.",
"Ah! I see.", 
"Indeed Captain. In fact it leads me to a proposition I have for you that you will find very profitable.",
"I need you to sail to Muscetto Cove on #sisland_Antigua# and pick up a very special cargo. Speak to no one about the matter. This is most important so I will pay you 50,000 now and 50,000 when you deliver it to the far shore on Jamaica. I will be there to meet you. Are you interested?",
"And take these East India Company identity papers. They will help you reprovision at #sisland_Antigua# should you need to.",
"I am in need of an escort to Jamaica, and we could use that trip to verify your skills. The Company will pay you 3,000 in gold upon our safe arrival.",
"Not yet Captain, we will execute the formalities in Jamaica. I am sure you have things to do, so I will meet you in the harbour when you are ready to sail.",
"I have taken your crew into custody aboard my ship. We were also observing the beach, so I also have Miss Anamaria in custody, and now you complete the set.",
"Your taunts are irrelevant. Tonight I shall have you branded a pirate. Tomorrow you will hang from my yardarm",
"Tomorrow is yet to come.",
"Then you will die, shortly followed by Miss Anamaria, then each member of your crew, very painfully I might add.",
"Well well, Captain Jack Sparrow... Fancy seeing you here.",
"Beckett, you finally caught up with me.",
"That I did Jack, and I am afraid that I will be taking your ship and having you hung. No hard feelings. It's just good business...",
"I'll give you business!",
"Goodbye, Jack Sparrow.",
"I could be. What do you have in mind? I'm still not sure I want to join the East India Trading Company, Sir Beckett.",
"What are you still doodling about? Be on your way!",
"Yes, sir. Immediately, sir.",
"I am informed that you command the 'Wicked Wench'. You should know that she belongs to the East India Trading Company. She was seized by Governor Brin while going about her lawful business. Apparently the governor, though tolerant of pirates, disliked certain of our trading practices, and took it upon himself to order the ship's internment.\nBut as you are her captain, and you now work for the Company, then the ship is back in Company hands.\nOf course, you do understand that should you leave the service of the Company, you will need to return the ship to us.",
"Excellent! Excellent! You have more than doubled the Company's investment in you. You are indeed an asset to the Company. You need no further training and are ready for a full role in the Company.", 
"Thank you, Sir Cutler.",
"I can live with those terms. [THINKS: Because if I leave the Company, the 'Wicked Wench' is leaving with me!] What role have you in mind for me?",
