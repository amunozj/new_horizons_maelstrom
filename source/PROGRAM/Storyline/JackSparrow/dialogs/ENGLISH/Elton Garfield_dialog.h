"Welcome to port #sisland_Turks#, captain, say, maybe you need a sailor to join your crew?",
"Well I'm not really looking for crew this moment...but I might give you a chance if you can give me some much needed information.",
"Information you say hmmm, I'm all ears cap'n!",
"You see, I'm looking for a certain bloke who goes by Atwood Paddley...",
"Aye! I have seen him in the tavern yesterday cap'n, he got too much rum for him and started a brawl, poor guy ended up locked away in our prison.",
"Then I shall need a way to have a word with him in this prison, he has something of mine on him, savvy?",
"That won't be easy captain, nobody can enter or escape on their own, unless you get brought in there by the guards, they usually patrol near the main hall.",
"Perfect, this is all I needed mate.", 
"But what about our agreement?!",
"Ah right, ye may join the crew... upon my safe return of course!",
