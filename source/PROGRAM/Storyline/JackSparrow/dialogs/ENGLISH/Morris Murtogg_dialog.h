"'Ere, What are you up to? This dock is off limits to civilians.",
"I'm terribly sorry. I didn't know. If I see one, I shall inform you immediately. I however, am working for Governor Lord Beckett so that doesn't apply to me. [THINKS: That might give me some leverage.]",
"Well, you're out of date, mate. Governor Weatherby Swann is in charge here now. Lord Beckett has gone back to the East India Company, so that makes you a civilian, and this dock is off limits to them, which means you.",
"That's a bit harsh. Why is it off limits then?", 
"Cos the Governor his-self said so. There's a big to-do up at the Fort and at the Residence and he doesn't want no interruptions sailin' between the two.",
"It's a fine goal to be sure but it seems to me that with all these ships here, there's not much chance of interruption. In fact with a ship like the Dauntless out there in the harbour, it makes the Interceptor tied up here a bit superfluous, really.",
"Oh, the Dauntless is the power in these waters, true enough, but there's no ship as can match the Interceptor for speed.",
"I've heard of one, supposed to be very fast - nigh un-catchable...the #scursedship#.",
"'Ere, What's your name then?",
"Smith, or Smithy, if you like.",
"Yea, and no lies mind you.",
"Well, then, I confess, it is my intention to commandeer one of these ships, pick up a crew in #sTortuga#, raid, pillage, plunder and otherwise pilfer my weasely way to get my ship back!",
"I said no lies!",
"?",
"If he were telling the truth, he wouldn't have told us.",
"Unless, of course, I knew you wouldn't believe the truth even if I told it to you.",
"[A SCREAM AND A SPLASH ARE HEARD FROM THE FORT]",
"A woman's just fallen from the battlements.",
"Me neither.",
"Pride of the King's Navy you two are. Here, hold my weapons. I suppose I shall have to do the noble deed.",
"Look here comes the Governor and the Commodore now. Look smart there, Mullroy",
"Yes, and give me my stuff back.",
"",
"Why is that?",
"Do the deed Captain, then return to me here and I will give you the answer.",
"I am getting into something deep here I know, but, I don't like the idea of slaves, so I will return shortly.",
"You were successful Captain.",
"Yes, I was able to...",
"That was a statement not a question Captain ",
", you have confirmed your character to me and proved yourself, so now I have something special that you must buy from me.",
"I kill three men and you want to sell me something?",
"No Captain, this is no ordinary sale. Give me 500 in gold so I can bribe the jailer and get passage for the slaves away from here to safety, and you get this compass.",
"A compass! I already have a compass.",
"Not a compass like this one. This one will lead you to what your heart desires most. Follow it with care.",
"You mean like the Chest of Cortez?",
"If that is what you desire the most, then yes.",
"Hmmm. That sounds as if you know something different. ",
"I do know Captain that you cannot return to your employer.",
"Ah! Yes. That will be a problem. Well, I do have somewhere else to go.",
"Yes Captain, back to the lighthouse at #sOxbay#.",
"You know about that too? Alright we will trade here is my gold.",
"And here is your compass. Your future is very complex Captain, but you should go now. Other guards are coming.",
"Yes I should, but what about you?",
