"Welcome to #sisland_Turks#, I am Sao Feng the Pirate Lord of the South China Sea. So, what business do you have for me?",
"I'd like offer my services.",
"Are you a captain? What's your name?",
"My name is Captain ",
", captain of the '",
"'.",
"Good, I'll remember your name. Now, tell me what made you come to me.",
"I'd like to talk business with you.",
"Nothing. I'll take my leave, if you'll allow me.",
"You can leave. But don't disappear completely, it's possible I'll have plans for you.",
"As you say, #saddr#.",
"I am all ears. What made you come to me?",
"Business, #saddr#.",
"I'm leaving.",
"Then let's talk business.",
"Something seems to be troubling you.",
"Your mission is a success. As you can see I've brought your missing ladies here.",
"I want to talk about a man who finds favor from your grace.",
"Your mission is accomplished, sir.",
"I don't have anything to discuss with you at the moment, #saddr#",
"Yes, I already know that, here is your reward. I hope that in future I will be able to use your services.",
"Any time, #saddr#.",
"So, who do you want to discuss.",
"A buccaneer, #sBernardo Gamboa#, sir.",
"",
"",
"Ah. That man?! And what do you want me to say? As far as I know, his reputation is stainless...",
"You would be wrong. From what I know he kidnapped a man from your town.",
"Ah, ah, ah. Are you sure about that? I don't want to insult him unjustly.",
"If you don't mind, I will investigate this privately. No one will know of your involvement. If he didn't kidnap this man, your relationship with him will remain intact, if he did, then you would show to everybody how just and powerful you are.",
"Hmmm... That is not unreasonable. Indeed, I don't risk anything in this case. You may find out what's going on. If your mission ends successfully, I'll reward you. But, since this is your initiative, it will be a modest sum.",
"Thank you sir.",
"Remind me, what were we discussing?",
"We were talking about a kidnapped man.",
"Ah, yes, I recall. As I understand, he really was kidnapped.",
"Yes. The scoundrel didn't want to give the man back and was slaughtered by his own men.",
"Well, no pirate - no problem. Here is your reward. You can leave my room now...",
"As you please.",
"Ah, so you think you can help me with my troubles?",
"Yes. If you permit it, oh great Sao Feng.",
"I can tell that you are a smart man, so I will tell you something.",
"I am all ears.",
"Two men were found dead today. One of them had a piece of a crimson fabric in his hand. \nSeveral hours before, they had discovered a corvette was spotted sailing away from the island under full sail. \n and to top it all off my two body guards are missing.",
"And this halts your investigation?",
"Well... It's obvious that my kidnapped bodyguards were taken away from the island. Under normal circumstances I would search for them myself. However I must stay here and can not get away to search as it would take too long. \nYou should understand that Captain. The sea offers many places to hide. Anyway, if you are so touched by the grief of this story, I offer you a challenge to find my ladies. \nI promise that if the search will be successful, I'll show my gratitude to you.",
"All right, I agree, but first I'd like to know where I can find a witness who saw the corvette.",
"No, I don't want to spend my time on such nonsense.",
"You accept? Perfect! You can find the witness in the tavern. It was my first mate who sighted that ship, he saw it while patrolling a region for me.",
"Thank you, may I take leave of you now?",
"I wish to serve Singapore's pirates, your Excellency.",
