"Please, tell me who you are. Why did you save me?",

"I was wondering if I could go and see Miss ",
"Arabella Silehard",
" again?",
"I don't see why not, we will sail to #sisland_Falaise De Fleur# soon.",
"No, you sail with me now and I won't have one of my officers running off like a love sick puppy",
"Captain, I think we should go and see the governor like Captain Maggee suggested.",
"Yes, I think you might be right.",
