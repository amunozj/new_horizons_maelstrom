"Halt! Who goes there, friend or foe?",
"Friend. Definitely friend.",
"We heard sounds of battle and came to investigate. Are you the captain of this ship?",
"Yes. A couple of the lads came back drunk and started some trouble. They're safely locked up and cooling off now.",
"Good. And you won't mind showing me the ship's papers, then.",
"Certainly, officer. Here they are.",
"Your name?",
"Alférez de Navío Esteban Rovapera.",
"And the ship's name?",
"Fortune.",
"Tonina.",
"I see. That's not what it says here. Drop your weapons, you are under arrest. Don't try to fight - there are more soldiers on the way, and even if you beat them, the fort is alerted to sink this ship if it attempts to leave.",
"Blast! I almost got away with it.",
"Thank you. That seems to be in order. Sorry for disturbing you.",
"Not at all, officer. Thank you for your vigilance. It would be terrible if pirates were to steal this ship while you were on watch.",
"Halt! What are you doing, leaving the residence at this time of night?",
"Perhaps you recognise ",
", who is taking an evening walk. I'm the escort.",
"Very well. Sorry to disturb you.",
"On the contrary, your alertness is commendable. We shall speak well of you when we next see the governor.",
"Halt! ",
" is engaged to be married, and not to you!",
"See this ring? It shows me to be an agent of ",
". Talking of rings, I'm authorised to escort ",
" to search for a suitable wedding ring.",
"In that case, I shall accompany you also. The governor would punish me if I allowed harm to come to ",
", and ",
" would be most displeased too.",
"That won't be necessary. As I said, I have the job of escort, and you should not desert your post.",
"My post is wherever there is risk to the governor or his family. As an agent of ",
", surely you do not object to extra security?",
"No, I suppose not. <Thinks: Too risky to just kill him. Look for an opportunity to get away from him.>",
"You won't find any rings for sale that way! I wonder if you were honest about your purpose with ",
"Sorry. I don't know this town very well, but I'm sure I'll find someone who can sell us a suitable ring.",
" will presumably receive the ring in there. But not today!",
"No, but at least I know where to bring it if that is my next job.",
"The store is the other way. This had better not be a deception - don't try to get ",
" onto your ship!",
"I had thought to try a trader in the port. But you are right, we should try the store first.",
"Did you find anything suitable in there?",
"No. Perhaps a trader near the port can sell us something better.",
"Halt! Where are you going at this time of night?",
"Back to my ship.",
"Who's this with you?",
"...",
"Cabin-boy? Your voice seems familiar - have we met somewhere before?",
"Er... no. <cough> Very well, go to your ship.",
"Thank you.",
"Drop your weapons! You are under arrest for the murder of a soldier going about his duty.",
"Not guilty, the reason being, that wasn't a soldier. Look at his gun. It's not a regulation musket, it's an old wheellock pistol. They aren't made any more, and when they were, only the best gunsmiths could do it. I'll wager not even your commander has a gun like this.",
"That may be, but you'll still need to come with me to the guardhouse to answer the charge.",
"Why don't we see my father-in-law instead? He'll sort this out.",
"I suppose your father-in-law is the governor? Ha ha!",
"Laugh all you want, that's exactly who he is.",
"You're lying!",
"If so, it's a stupid lie. If we go there and I'm lying, he'll do something unpleasantly amusing to me. If you prevent me going there and I'm telling the truth, he'll do something unpleasantly amusing to you.",
"Excellency, this #snoun# is accused of attacking a soldier but claims to be your #srelation-in-law#.",
"The 'soldier' was the assassin, Excellency.",
"Ah, there you are. My men will be here soon, then we can search the ship.",
"Thank you. If we find ",
", you will please arrest the crew. But leave the captain to us.",
"We've searched most of the ship but have not found anything suspicious. Have you found anything?",
"Yes. Allow me to present ",
", #srelation# of ",
". This is who we were looking for. Please proceed with the arrest - but leave the captain to me.",
"No, his sister. He's badly sick and I've been tending to him. A couple of the lads came back drunk and started some trouble. They're safely locked up and cooling off now.",
"Lareina Rovapera, and the captain's name is Alférez de Navío Esteban Rovapera.",
"Can't you see that I'm on duty! Don't bother me.",
"All right, all right.",
"Halt! No unauthorised person is allowed in here.",
"I wish to visit a prisoner.",
"You are only allowed in if you have a visitor's pass. Do you have one?",
"Certainly, here it is.",
"You mean this sort of pass? <You show the soldier a gold coin.>",
"Not yet. I shall go and get one.",
"Who needs a pass when I have a sword?",
"Very well. You may enter.",
"Thank you, soldier.",
"You think to fool me with this blatant forgery? Leave now, before I put you in a cell of your own!",
"It looked alright to me. I'll get a better - er, a real one.",
"Well, the Retired Soldiers Fund could always do with a donation of 5000 of those.",
"Here you are. Enjoy your 'retirement'.",
"I don't have that much with me. Goodbye.",
"Did you enjoy your visit? Your donation only paid for you to get in, of course. A similar donation will allow you to leave.",
"Bad move. If I'd killed you outside, the rest of the guards would have joined in. But here you are on your own.",
"Very well. Aren't you lucky I'm rich and generous?",
"That pass didn't look quite right. I've just remembered that the governor uses blue ink, not black. You can leave but you'll need to pay a fine of 5000 gold coins first.",
"Halt! Where are you going?",
"Shouldn't you show more respect to a sergeant?",
"Sorry, sergeant.",
"I've just told the sergeant about smugglers on the beach. He's not going to call out the guard on my word, of course. So I'm going to show him, then he'll decide how many troops he needs to deal with them.",
"Do you want us to come along, sergeant?",
"Should we check on the prisoner?",
"Who are you? Why are you not in uniform?",
"I am ",
". Unlike some people who have a nice job standing on a beach, we've been working to clear up the old fort. I did not want to get the uniform dirty.",
"You had better get back into uniform soon, then.",
"Is there a reason for the hurry?",
"Are you ",
"Yes, I am he. What do you want?",
"Who are these... people?",
"Former pirates. Junior crewmembers, nobody important. They were wise enough to surrender and throw themselves on the mercy of the French crown. I've been putting them to work in the fort,",
"Hmm. Personally I'd have hanged the lot of them.",
"That would be a waste of a good workforce. But why are you here, Lieutenant? Have you a message for me?",
"You are ordered to report to the flagship.",
"What for?",
"I don't question orders! All I know is that the Contre-Amiral is calling a conference of captains and you are required to attend.",
"Very well, I shall proceed to the flagship. <Thinks: I hope the Contre-Amiral doesn't know the real ",
", or this could get very nasty...>",
"Halt! You are under arrest for assisting the French attack on this town.",
"What? I'm the reason your gates aren't open and the French are still outside this town!",
"A likely story. You'll spend the rest of the night in prison. Tomorrow the governor will decide your fate. Meanwhile my men will deal with your friends outside.",
"I should never have got involved...",
"It's true, sir. A gang attacked us. We thought we'd had it. Then this #sperson# showed up, joined in on our side, much to my surprise I may add, and we won. The gate is secure, sir.",
"I see. In that case, here's 5 coins - enjoy a night in the tavern at my expense. Tomorrow the governor will reward you properly. You can leave the French army to us.",
"Thanks! Looks like getting involved paid off after all - glad to be of help.",
"Get up, you! The governor has sent for you. If you're lucky, he's only going to hang you.",
"What's he going to do if I'm not lucky - read poetry at me first?",
"Were you trying to sleep? Don't worry, you'll soon be sleeping permanently.",
"I shouldn't even be in here if I hadn't mistaken a French flag for a surrender flag. Both white - you'd think the French always want to surrender!",
"Continue to insult our glorious flag and I'll shoot you right now!",
"You wouldn't want to do that. The governor is looking forward to a hanging. If you deprive him of my company, he may make you guest of honour instead.",
"Yes, I should save the bullet for someone more deserving. Perhaps I'll be allowed to watch you dangle.",
"Your mother was a hamster and your father smelled of elderberries!",
"That does it! Nobody insults a small furry animal while I'm on watch! I may not be allowed to shoot you but I can certainly beat you senseless!",
"Come and try it, then!",
"Yes, soon I'll be dead. And you'll have missed your chance.",
"What do you mean?",
"Here I am, at your mercy, an attractive woman. You could do whatever you want and nobody would know.",
"No, I'd best stay on my side of this door.",
"I'm just a slip of a girl - what am I going to do, knock you out? Go on, give me one last night of pleasure and enjoy yourself too.",
"Well, since you put it like that...",
"Oh, I do...",
"Right! Now I'll teach you some manners!",
"Would you please give me your keys and weapons?",
"Let us get comfortable, my dear.",
"Sleep well, 'dear'.",
"You are under arrest for crimes against the French crown. Lay down your arms. If you resist, you will be shot.",
"Very well, I surrender.",
"You won't get me without a fight!",
"What is your business here?",
"I am here to take these prisoners out.",
"By what authority?",
"By the authority of this sword!",
"By the authority of this document, signed by the governor.",
"Let's see... Hmm... Very well.\nPRISONERS! You are to follow this #sperson# and do anything #spronoun# commands. Anyone who gives the slightest trouble will be punished harshly!",
"Thank you, sir.",
"Let's see... This document authorises an officer to take charge of the prisoners. You don't look like an officer - in fact, you look as though you should join the prisoners.\nSurrender your weapons and stand over there, now!",
"Not likely. I'm taking those men out of here, one way or another!",
"I am ",
", commander of #sRedmond# fort. Who the blazes are you?",
"My name is ",
". #sgovernor#, your governor, asked me to give you a hand with your French problem.",
"The French were not a problem. We had the battle well under control.",
"That wasn't how it appeared to me, or for that matter, the governor. Which reminds me, I really need to get back to him. He owes me a lot of money for this.",
"Of course, of course. I shall have a couple of my men escort you back to the residence.",
"That won't be necessary. I can find my own way.",
"Nonsense! It's the least I can do. We wouldn't want you to get lost on the way to town, would we?",
"Well, if you insist, I suppose it can't do any harm. Goodbye.",
"Excellency, the French fleet is defeated! And it wasn't our ships which did it. I don't know who they were, but if they were the devil's own pirates themselves, I couldn't have been more pleased to see what they did to the French!",
"Drop your weapons! You, ",
", are under arrest!",
"On what charge?",
"On the charge of high treason. Drop your weapons or you will be shot here and now!",
"If there weren't so many of you, I'd take my chances. But since I don't recall doing anything treasonous, lead on.",
"Halt! You, ",
", are under arrest for the kidnapping of ",
"!",
"Don't be stupid!",
"Yes, ma'am.",
"Er, yes, your Highness. You can both proceed.",
"Thank you, soldier.",
"! You are to be taken before ",
".",
"Good. I am here to see the admiral. Lead on.",
"What are your orders, ",
"?",
"Two of you, stay here. The other two, follow me.",
"Did you arrest ",
"?",
"He chose to resist and I killed him. Arrange for the removal of the body, if you please. Meanwhile I shall return to ",
" to make my report.",
"Did you want to report some crime?",
"Yes, soldier. I am ",
". Your governor has sent word of my mission here, I believe?",
"Yes, ",
". You have uncovered a French spy. Is that him?",
"No, this is ",
". The real one. That one over there is the French spy pretending to be ",
". If you would please arrest the impostor, this man can get back to work.",
"Now how do we tell which ",
" is the real one?",
"You, take this one aside.",
"And you, take the other one. Each of you will ask your man this question: 'If the other man were asked who is the spy, what would he say?'",
"I have his answer. My man says, the other man would say that my man is the spy.",
"My man says, the other man would say that he is the spy.",
"Then your man is the spy. Arrest him and release the other one!",
"How do you know?",
"Obviously the spy is not going to admit to being the spy. He's going to say that the other man is the spy.",
"Of course he would. But why did one of the men say that the other would confess to being the spy?",
"It's obvious to you and me. It's also obvious to the spy, to whom lying comes as easily as breathing. But the real ",
" is a simple man who knows little of deception. To him, that man is the spy, therefore he would say that he is the spy.",
"Too bad. He might have been able to tell us all sorts of interesting things.",
"<Thinks: most fortunate; now he can't tell anyone who brought him here.> Yes, most unfortunate. Now we'll never know how he got here. I'll leave you to dispose of the body. Meanwhile I must report back to the governor.",
"son-in-law",
"daughter-in-law",
"I am starting work as a servant to ",
".",
"Not while you're dressed like that!",
"That is what he said. So we're going to get something which he finds more appropriate.",
"That won't be necessary. We will find the tailor's shop without your help.",
"Do you really think a mere servant girl has the right to tell a soldier of the guard his job?",
"That is not the tailor's shop! Follow your master or lose your job!",
"Sorry, I'm new to #sSantiago# and was looking around. But you are right, I should concentrate on finding the tailor's shop.",
"Why are you going to the port? You are behaving very suspiciously - the tailor's shop is in the opposite direction!",
"No, sir. I just got a bit lost. Thank you for reminding me where to find the shop. I shall go there now.",
"May I remind you that you are NOT the one getting married in there!",
"Not today, anyway.",
"<To ",
"> As you wish, ",
".",
"Your cunning disguise does not fool me, ",
"! It might have worked if you had continued to wear it.",
"I'll have to remember that. If I want a disguise to succeed, I must stay in disguise.",
