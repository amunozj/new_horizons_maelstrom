"Rumour has it that you need some help getting some resources, is that true?",
"Aye, indeed I'm in need of some supplies. The storekeeper says he will not have any of these supplies any time soon. Could you fetch me ",

"I've got the goods you asked for.",
"My apologies. Unfortunately I was unable to get the goods for you in time.",
"...",
"As promised, here is your pay. Thank you very much for getting these goods.",
"I couldn't get your whole delivery in one go, so here is the first part.",
"Ah, thank you very much. Please get the rest as soon as possible. I'm going to use these resources already, so if you don't deliver the rest I still have to cancel the order, but I can't return these resources either, just so you know.",
"You know what, I will keep them with me then until I have everything",
