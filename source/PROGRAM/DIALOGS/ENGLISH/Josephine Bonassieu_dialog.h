"Nothing. I'm here on business.",
"Oh! I'm very sorry. I didn't mean to bother you. I'll go back to my work.",
"No, wait - you're not bothering me. In fact, you're the one I need to speak with.",
"Not so fast. I want to talk to you.",
"I am all ears. How can I help you?",
"I need to hire some sailors.",
"I'm looking to add to my crew.",

"I'd like a room.",
"Do you have a free room in this place?",
"Never mind. I've got to go.",
"Certainly, ",
". What's on your mind?",
"Tell me: Who owns the house near your tavern?",
"Actually, it's nothing important.",
"I do have a vacancy. How long were you planning to be with us?",
"I'll be staying the night.",
"Just until sundown.",
"Fine. It'll cost you five gold pieces.",
"All right. Here you go.",
"That much? It looks like I'll be spending the night in the tavern hall.",

"I'll think about it. For now, let me ask you another question.",
"It'll cost you five gold pieces.",

"Well, it's pretty late. Everyone you might hire will have found a place to spend the night.\nYou're better off waiting 'til morning. Maybe I could rent you a room? ",
"Do you have a free room?",
"No. I have another question.",
"Friends, please! Enough of this madness. Don't make me call out the guard!",
"Relax! I'm leaving.",
"Yes? What do you want?",
"I'd like to spend some good times 'if you understand'. Could you help me to find a woman?",
"Hahaha! Of course, Captain. 'I understand'. Talk to Laura Cotton.",
"Where is she?",
"At this hour, I suppose at home. It's the house next to the exit to the jungles.",
"Thanks!",
"Actually, we're looking for Short Jack Gold. Have you heard of him?",
"Ah! The great Short Jack Gold... You won't find him in here M'dear. Try the Townhall. He's usually in there working on some program or another for the island with the rest of the Island Council.",
"O.K. Thanks.",
