"I see. I have a question.",
"Thank you, goodbye.",
"They say you can count on him. On the other hand, I've heard that he doesn't like to take unnecessary risks and always does his business prudently. I don't think he's into any shady business either.",
"I see. I have a question.",
"Thank you, goodbye.",
"A great lad. Always ready to help. I must say that for a backwater like this, he's quite a fine shipbuilder.",
"I see. I have a question.",
"Thank you, goodbye.",
"He's not very successful. He trades and trades, but always seems to end up poorer. Items are often out of stock. And he's always deep in debt.",

"I see. Thank you. Good-bye.",
"And where is the shipyard?",
"Where can I sell the fine goods that I brought with me?",
"You will see the shipyard if you look right. The building on the other side of the river is it. You must go over the little wooden bridge to get there.",
"I see. And how can I get to the tavern?",
"Where can I sell the goods that I brought with me?",
"Thanks for your help. That is all I need to know.",
"Oh, that's easy, ",
"! go left after the landing bridge and then right at the first crossing. You should now stand in front of the store.",
"Where is the shipyard in this city?",
"How can I get to the tavern?",
"I see. That's all I need to know.",
"To be honest, I don't know much about it, but I can tell you what I do know.",
"What do you want to know about our colony?",
"With pleasure. What exactly do you want to know about?",
"I'd like to know the history of the colony...",
"Is there is anything else besides the city on this island?",
"Do you know anything about the fort that protects the city?",
"Let's talk about something else.",
"Our colony was built about 40 years ago. The island is pretty small, but it has very fertile soil, and there are a couple of convenient bays.\nNew sections are being developed, and trade has increased. The first settlement was a small outpost on the other side of the island, a rough place which may still be there for all I know. Later, a larger settlement was founded here which eventually became #sCharlestown#.",
"Continue...",
"That's clear. Let's talk about something else ",
"Then buccaneers became frequent visitors here, so they built the fort to protect the city.",
"I see. Let's end our conversation on that subject, and change the subject.",
"Most of the island is already developed. It's difficult to develop further because it's hard labor to clear the dense jungle, and we don't have enough people here to do that...",
"All right, tell me something else.",
"There is nothing special on our island. All islands are more or less the same in this archipelago.",
"I see. Continue...",
"We've got jungle, rocks, and deserted beaches...and I guess that's about it. Well, there is also the pirate settlement here, of course.",
"I see. Continue...",
"I see. Let's end our conversation on that subject, and change the subject.",
"I don't know anything.",
"That's too bad. Tell me more about the colony.",
"There is nothing special about the fort. It has thick walls, long-range cannons, and there are 1000 soldiers in the garrison.",
"I see. Continue...",
"Why do you want to know, captain? It's not very smart for me to chatter about the fort with every stranger. How do I know what you have on your mind?",
"Well, if the fort is such a sensitive subject for you, then let's not talk about it. Tell me about the colony.",
"I see. Let's end our conversation on that, and change the subject.",
" We have a population of ",
" citizens.",
