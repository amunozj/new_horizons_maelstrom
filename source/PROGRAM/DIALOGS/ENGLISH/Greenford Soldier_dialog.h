"Can't you see that I'm on duty! Don't bother me.",
"All right, all right.",
"Did you want to report some crime?",
"No, of course. I am a captain, after all...but I see you are not listening.",
"Remember - we don't allow fighting in the streets. You can defend yourself, of course, if somebody attacks you.",
"Right, I'll consider that information.",
"Such weather...and I've got to stand here in it. You may not believe me, but the only entertainment available is fighting the flies that try to land on my face.",
"That's most unfortunate, but I can't help you. It's your work.",
"If you want to chat, find somebody else. I've got my duty to do, and it's not my duty to talk to you.",
"I was just wondering whether you are alive or not. You are standing here like a statue.",
"Do you think it's easy to protect our city? Not at all! It is a very important and dangerous job. I remember once...",
"Tell me some other time. I've got to go.",
"Go your way, don't bother me.",
"As you say, soldier.",
"Hey! Won't you bring me a cup of rum from the tavern?",
"Perhaps. But won't they hang me up for helping a soldier get drunk on duty? No, wait 'til they change the guard, and then you can drink as much as you wish.",
"Why must it be a rough-looking sailor like you trying to talk to me?! Aren't there any beautiful women in this city?",
"And you call this doing your duty? Look, you wouldn't want to miss capturing some dangerous criminal like myself, would you? Ha-ha!",
"You look pretty healthy. Don't you want to join our army? We've got lots of room in our barracks, good food, rum for free.",
"Sounds good, but I'll have to decline your offer. I don't fancy army discipline.",
"This heat.... I'd give anything to return to dear old England.",
"Yes, it doesn't look like this weather suits you.",
"I need your help to save one man.",
"I want to know more about what's going on in the town recently.",
"What exactly do you want to know? There's always something happening in the town, I don't know all the rumours. You'd better ask in the tavern.",
"I think you can help me. I'm interested in information about a man who was accused of murder, and who then ran away.",
"Ah, that! Of course I know about it.",
"Tell me all the details. His Honour, the governor, ordered me to investigate this case.",
"How do I know that you are representing the governor here?",
"Look, this letter was signed by the governor himself.",
"Anyway, you'd better talk to the prison commander, ",
", he knows better what happened.",
"I will talk to him later, but now I want to know what you know.",
"All right, ask your questions.",
"Tell me in detail how was he arrested, what items he had, how he escaped.",
"It was late at night when I and my partner was patrolling the streets...",
"Do you mean that you arrested him yourself?",
"That's true.",
"Continue.",
"And suddenly we see a girl dressed in men's clothing coming from a house, with blood on her boots.",
"So you say you saw blood on #spronoun3# boots that night?",
"I saw #spronoun2# in a street light.",
"Ah. Then what?",
"We arrested #spronoun2#, and then, when we saw a corpse lying in a pool of blood, we took the #sgirl# into custody.",
"I see. Did you find anything interesting on #spronoun2#?",
"I was searching #spronoun2#, but I was interrupted.",
"What do you mean?",
"Can you imagine? This other fellow tried to steal a little boat, and when we caught him, we took a strange golden idol from him.",
"That's interesting. And what happened to this idol?",
"That's my misfortune. The captain was on night patrol. So he took the idol.",
"Thanks for the help, soldier.",
"Don't mention it, ",
", it's my duty to protect citizens.",
"Perfect! Then help me to prevent the killing of an old man.",
"Well.... Look, ",
" I can't help you.",
"Why is that, soldier? Isn't he a citizen of this town?",
"Of course he is.",
"Then what? Surely you don't believe that he is a sorcerer...",
"No! If he was, he could fly away and escape.",
"So why don't you help me?",
"You must understand - everybody believes that he serves Satan, and we can't have that in this town.",
"So you're afraid of a public nuisance?",
"Something like that, ",
".",
"And what if I will pay you and your partner 200 gold?",
"I'm on duty!",
"I see that I can't persuade you.",
"All right, ",
". Give me your money. There are 6 of us here, so that's 1200 gold. Rest assured, the man's life is safe.",
"Good, here is your money.",
"Now, that's more than I can afford.",
"Go away, ",
".",
"Bring me the old man, I'll wait near the gate.",
"Don't speak to me like this, ",
"! I serve England!",
"Look! An innocent man dies, and you do nothing? You don't serve anything...you're just too timid to face a little danger!",
"Maybe so, ",
"! But to show you I'm no coward, I will bring you your man. Wait for me near the gate.",
"That sounds good, my friend.",
"What do you want?",
"You...hic...you scurvy cur! You hurt my...hic...my friend!",
"What friend? You're alone here, ",
".",
"What? He was...here a minute ago. I'll go find him. You...hic...you'll wait right here if you want your beating....",
"How dare you contradict me! I'm gonna strangle you!",
"And suddenly we see a man coming from a house, with blood on his boots.",
