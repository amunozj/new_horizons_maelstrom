"Hello, ",
", to what do I owe the honor of your presence?",
"I am sorry, but are you not called ",
"?",
"Hey, you! Yes, you. You are called ",
", yes?",
"Nothing, I'm just seeing the sights. Getting a feel for the city.",
"None of your business!",
"I've spoken with a few people around here, and they tell me you're a decent fellow.",
"I've spoken with the innkeeper, you know, and he didn't back up your words. I have to believe you lied to me.",
"I'd like to talk to you about this sticky situation between you and the shopkeeper.",
"I'm looking for a paymaster for my ship, and I think you might be the right man for the job. What do you say?",
"I've paid off your debt to ",
"Arnaud Matton",
". Now you're free to serve as paymaster on my ship.",
". However I don't need your services.",
"I've paid off your debt.",
"Do you want to hire me as your ship's paymaster?",
"Yes. I think you'd be a fine addition to my crew.",
"Oh, here you are. I was just wondering when you were going to appear.",
"I can see you're in business again. Judging by your happy face it suits you too.",
"I'm sorry, #smonsieur# -- I mistook you for another man.",
"I'm just passing by. I've got no time for the likes of you.",
"Very well. But if you should need a paymaster someday, I'm the man for the job.",
"Yeah, I'll keep that in mind.",
"You're a captain, are you not?",
"Yes, I am - but how do you know that?",
"Yes - pretending it's your business - I am a captain. But how did you know that? And why do you care?",
"I'm sorry. I've got no time to talk with you.",
"I don't have time for the likes of you. Leave me alone!",
"I consider it part of my job to know, just by looking at a #sgender#, what #spronoun# does and what sort of fellow #spronoun# is.",
"Part of your job? You don't look like a captain of the guard. No, you're most likely a banker.",
"Oh, really? A man as sharp as you must be a captain of the guard. Or are you simply a money lender?",
"Yes, well - that's an amusing parlor trick, I'm sure. But I've got business elsewhere.",
"You've wasted enough of my time. Leave me be.",
"No, ",
", I'm not a banker and certainly not a captain of the guard. I'm a humble merchant. Or, at least, I was.",
"And you're not anymore? This seems a strange place to retire.",
"And what do you do now? Did you rob enough of your customers to retire?",
"Alas, no. I have not retired. Not by choice, at any rate. My store was stolen from under my nose. But, of course, this is my problem. I'm sorry to burden you with it.",
"Not at all. Tell me more. Maybe I can help.",
"At this point, I'm getting used to it. Everyone seems to want me to fix their lives. Maybe I can help you, too. Not for free, of course. But even you must have something to offer in exchange for my help.",
"No, no. Everything is fine. I should be going.",
"Right. Me, too. Goodbye.",
"There's not much more to tell. I was the owner of the local store, but my assistant, ",
"Arnaud Matton",
"Arnaud Matton",
", managed to rob me blind and take my store. \nI was willing to work, to get back on my feet again, but no one wanted to loan me any money - except ",
"Arnaud Matton",
" himself\nMy position was desperate. What could I do but accept? But he managed to trick me again, and now I find myself worse than penniless owing 2500. So I'm up to my eyes in debt.",
"Maybe there's some way I can help.",
"I'd be glad to help you...but not for free, of course.",
"That's a very sad story, but I don't see how I could help. And I must be going.",
"Seems to me it's your own fault. If you hadn't been so trusting, you would never have lost your business to your own assistant. Goodbye!",
"Here's what I propose, ",
": If you will loan me 10000 gold, I'll be able to pay off my debt to ",
"Arnaud Matton",
". I'll sink the rest of the money into my business, and within a month I'll be able to pay you back. I guarantee it.",
"Well, I suppose I could lend you the money - but just for a month.",
"I've got a better idea. I need a paymaster for my ship. What do you say?",
"I'm afraid I can't help you.",
"I'm sorry, ",
", but I don't believe you can help me after all.",
"Well, I'm sorry to hear that. Goodbye.",
"Well, that's the best I can offer you. If you're not interested, I'll be going.",
"That might be my name. Who's asking, and why?",
"I here on behalf of the shopkeeper, ",
"Arnaud Matton",
", to collect the money you owe him.",
"Don't play games with me. I'm told you owe money to a respected citizen, but you don't want to pay it back.",
"I'd be happy to pay my debts, if only I could. I simply don't have the money.",
"Arnaud Matton",
" told me you'd say that. And he told me not to fall for it.",
"Do I look like a fool to you? ",
"Arnaud Matton",
" told me you were a swindler and a liar, and that you do indeed have the money. You'd be wise to hand it over while you still can.",
"No one has ever dared call me a liar, ",
"!",
"That doesn't make you an honest man. Can someone vouch for your character?",
"Perhaps not. But I trust ",
"Arnaud Matton",
"'s opinion of you. I'm not falling for your act.",
"Don't take that tone with me. I'm not one of the local rubes!",
"Ask anyone you like. The tavern-keeper, for instance! He'll tell you I'm an honest man, ",
".",
"All right. I'll check your story out.",
"What are you going to do?",
"I'll go have a talk with ",
"Arnaud Matton",
", and then we'll see.",
"Maybe I can help you.",
"You know, ",
"Arnaud Matton",
", maybe I can help you out. In exchange for a little coin, of course.",
"All right. I'll await ",
"Arnaud Matton",
"'s decision, but I'm sure he'll only send me to jail.",
"Don't go reading the tea leaves yet. Only time can tell what time will bring.",
"As you say, ",
".",
"Farewell.",
"You've been asking to be thrown in jail for a long time, and I'm just the one to put you there!",
"How about this, ",
": If you'll lend me 10000 gold, I'll be able to pay off my debt to ",
"Arnaud Matton",
" and sink the rest of the money back into my business. Within a month, I'll pay you back in full.",
"Well, I suppose I could loan you the money. But just for a month.",
"I've got a better idea. I need a paymaster for my ship, and you seem to know a thing or two about giving other people money. It's a job. What do you say?",
"I'm afraid I may have spoken too soon. I don't think I can do anything for you.",
"I'm sorry, ",
", but I don't think you can help me.",
"That's a shame. Goodbye.",
"Well, that's the best I can offer you. If you're not interested, I'll be going.",
"That's an intriguing offer, ",
", but you helped me restart in business for myself. ",
"Of course, and judging by how quickly you could repay me you will be successful too. I wish you good luck in your venture.",
"Good that's settled then. I'm glad to have you as a part of my crew.",
"That's a very interesting offer, ",
", but it wouldn't be right for me to leave town while I'm still in debt to ",
"Arnaud Matton",
".",
"How about if I square your debt, and you can pay me back out of your earnings - life on board is all funded so you can give most of it straight back. Is it a deal?",
"I'm sorry, but I guess I can't do anything for you. Farewell!",
"Thank you so much, ",
". I'll pay you back in a month. See if I don't!",
"Perfect. I'll see you in a month, then.",
"It's a deal, ",
"! If you can clear my debt with ",
"Arnaud Matton",
" I'll be honored to join your crew.",
"Perfect. And now, if you'll excuse me....",
"I'm sorry, captain - but where should I wait for you?",
"My ship is the '",
"'. Wait for me there.",
"Excellent, captain. Thank you for your help. Where should I wait for you?",
"My ship is the '",
"'. Wait for me there.",
"Yes, of course, ",
". Here is your money as we agreed. You'll find I've added a bonus as a token of my appreciation.",
"Excellent! I'm glad my trust in you wasn't misplaced. And now, if you'll pardon me, I have to be going.",
"I have a proposition for you. What would you think of joining my crew as paymaster?",
"I'll pay you back when the month is up, Captain.",
"Do you want to trade Captain?",
"Yes, show me some personal items.",
"Yes, I could use some provisions.",
"Not at the moment. Bye.",
"Perfect I can wait until then.",
"Well met again Captain.",
"I hope business is good.",
