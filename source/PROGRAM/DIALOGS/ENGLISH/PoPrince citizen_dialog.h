". What is it, ",
"?",

"?",
"Is this your first time in our city, ",

"I'm ",
", captain and owner of the ship '",
".' I've got some questions if you have a moment.",
"My name is ",
". I'd like to ask you some questions.",
"You can call me captain ",
". I'd just like some information.",
"Hello, captain ",
". What brings you to our colony?",
"Ah, captain ",
". ",
", it's you again. I hope your journey was a pleasant one. What's new?",
"Hello, ",
". How can I help you?",
"Did I miss anything while I was away?",
"Has anything interesting happened while I was gone?",
"What stories are the old sea dogs swapping over their rum these days?",
"What's the buzz in the taverns?",
"I'm looking for gossip, rumors, tall tales...anything I don't know may be of use.",
"Dish me up some of your freshest gossip, friend. There may be adventure or money to be found in even the smallest tidbit.",
"I still can't find...",
"It's impossible to find anything in this maze! Where is...",
"I'm as lost as a drunken navigator. Again!",
"You look like a local. Tell me where I can find...",
"Please tell me how to get to...",
"I've had a rotten day, so you'll save us both grief if you'll just tell me how to find...",
"I'd like your opinion on a local citizen.",
"I need to know whatever you can tell me about someone who lives here in town.",
"What can you tell me about...",
"Tell me whatever you can about one fellow...",
"I'm hoping you can tell me something about a person you may know.",
"This place isn't too big - I'll bet you know everyone who lives here. Let's talk.",
"Tell me about #sPort au Prince#.",
"What can you tell me about this god-forsaken place?",
"I'd like to know more about this fine colony.",
"What's the story of this city and the island?",
"Do you know anything of interest about #sPort au Prince#?",
"...",
"I'm sorry. I thought you were someone else.",
"I'm just passing through. So stand aside or be pushed.",
"What would you like to know, ",
"?",
"What interests you, captain?",
"What do you want from me?",
"Towns like this are always swimming with gossip. Give me the highlights.",
"Has anything interesting happened around here lately?",
"I just want to know what's going on in the neighborhood. Someone's swindled a friend? Someone's been killed? The innkeeper's really a woman? You get my drift.",
"How can I get to...",
"Can you help me find my bearings here in town?",
"Where can I find...",
"Can you tell me about someone I'm interested in?",
"I'd like some information about one local fellow. Could you help?",
"I'm wondering what people in town have to say about a certain person...",
"What can you tell me about #sPort au Prince#?",
"I'd like to know the history of your city.",
"I'd like to get some information about this colony.",
"I'm just walking here. I'll see you later.",
"Thank you. There is one more thing...",
"It was nice to chat with you. So long!",
"Anything else, captain ",
"?",
"Let's hear it, ",
".",
"I'm listening, ",
".",
"What's the talk of the town these days?",
"What stories are the old sea dogs swapping over their rum these days?",
"It's been a long time since I've set foot on these shores. What have I missed?",
"Could you give me some directions?",
"I've gotten myself absolutely lost in these streets.",
"It's my first time in this city, and I'd like some directions.",
"I'd like your opinion on a local citizen.",
"I need to know whatever you can tell me about someone who lives here in town.",
"Could you give me some information about the locals?",
"Tell me about #sPort au Prince#.",
"What can you tell me about this colony?",
"I'd like to know something about #sPort au Prince#.",
"I've just realized I have to be somewhere. Goodbye.",
"Who do you mean,",
"?",
"Are you asking about someone specific?",
"Who exactly do you want to know about?",
"I mean the governor.",
"I am interested in the owner of the tavern.",
"The owner of the shipyard.",
"I'm talking about the local trader.",
"No one. Never mind.",
"Hmm.. what should I say? She treats us good, and our city has a good time since she leads it.",
"I see. I have another question for you.",
"Thank you, bye-bye.",
"He has always a joke for you. And he knows so much about whats going on in the world! He must be a good listener.",
"I see. I have another question for you.",
"Thank you, bye-bye.",
"He's a lonly man. He has only his ships. But therefore, he knows everything about them. If somebody has to fix your ship, then he's the right man.",
"I see. I have another question for you.",
"Thank you, bye-bye.",
"He is very greedy. Some say that he was Baldewin Coffier's assistant, but when the store went bust, he bought it for a low price. I don't know about the quality or price of his goods, but he doesn't seem to be a very...good person.",
"I see. I have another question for you.",
"Thank you, bye-bye.",
"Where are you headed, ",
"?",
"Not a problem, captain. Where do you need to be?",
"I'm happy to guide you, ",
". But where do you want to go?",
"How can I get to the tavern?",
"Where's the shipyard?",
"Where can I sell the goods I've brought with me?",
"That's easy. When you come from the port it is the left house. Just go through the small passage between the two houses and turn left and you'll see the door.",
"Fine. Thanks for your time.",
"Where's the shipyard?",
"Where can I get a decent price for fine goods I've brought to town?",
"The shipyard is the big house downtown. You can't oversee it. ",
"I see. And the tavern?",
"Where can I get a decent price for fine goods I've brought to town?",
"I think that's everything. Thanks for your help.",
"Do you know where the tavern is? The shop is across from it. ",
"Where can I find the local shipyard?",
"How do I get to the tavern?",
"I see. Thanks for the information.",
"I'm not sure why you'd be interested, but why not?",
"What exactly are you interested in, ",
"?",
"Of course, ",
". but it's a rather complicated story.",
"I'm interested in the history of the colony...",
"Tell me about the colony.",
"Is there anything on the island besides the town?",
"I have a few more questions for you, if you don't mind.",
"First the Spanish people had taken this land. Then the French came and conquered it. Then in 1749 #sPort au Prince# was founded.",
"Thanks. Let me ask you a few more questions.",
"You know, I really thought that was going to be more interesting. Let me ask you something else.",
"That's all I need. Thanks.",
"Thanks for your time. Farewell.",
"Well, on the other side of the island there is #sSanto Domingo#. We also have a few plantations. But the rest is jungle.",
"What else can you tell me about the colony?",
"What else can you tell me?",
"And our church is also the oldest one. We set the first stone in 1521 and finished it in 1540.",
"I see. What else?",
"No. You'll find a couple of plantations and houses on this part of the island, but it's largely undeveloped.",
"In that case, maybe you can tell me more about the colony.",
"Got it. Let me ask you something else.",
"Do you know a boatswain named Fred Bob?",
"What can you tell me about the harbormaster?",
"Oh, Fred Bob? He's not a mutineer, I'll tell you that! He's a good mariner, and a strong man to have on your side when you're outnumbered. Pity about his imprisonment. We all hope the governor will release him, because no one but that pompous first officer believes he is guilty.",
"Interesting. Oh, I have another question for you.",
"Thank you very much, farewell.",
"I don't know how he does it, but our harbormaster makes it his job to know of every mariner in the archipelago.",
"I see. One more question, if you don't mind, please?",
"Thank you for your time. Bye.",
"Fred Bob? The boatswain? He's awfully hard to understand, but my brother knows him well. He's not a mutineer. That officer has it all wrong. We all hope the governor sets him free. He belongs on a ship, not in the stockade.",
"Fine man, excellent mariner. I don't believe for one minute that he threatened mutiny.",
"Ehm... I plumb forgot who I was going to inquire of. Just give me a second and it'll come back to me...",
"How's that old metalworker Tomas fare these days?",
"You mean Tomasina, don'cha commandant gobeur? Ol' Tomas up and died not a while back, and it's his wife presidin' over the anvil now. Can't say she does a bad job of it, either.",
"Oh my... doesn't she come down with the vapours quite often in that profession? Nevermind; on to happier things.",
"Well, in that case I shall have to pay my respects immediately...",
"My all-time best most favourite sword in the world here has gotten a bit dull as of late. To whom might I entrust it?",
"We have a blacksmith? That's the first time I heard about that. Let me know if you have found him.",
"Well, okay I shall look there then. Thanks, anyway.",
"Where's the shipyard?",
"Where can I get a decent price for fine goods I've brought to town?",
"To whom might I entrust my sword? Its once-fine edge has gotten a bit dulled.",
" We have a population of ",
" citizens.",
