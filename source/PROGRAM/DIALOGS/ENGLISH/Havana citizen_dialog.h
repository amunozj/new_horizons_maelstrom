". I'd like to ask you some questions.",
"You can call me captain ",
". I'd just like some information.",
"Hello, captain ",
". What brings you to our colony?",
"Ah, captain ",
". ",
", it's you again. I hope your journey was a pleasant one. What's new?",
"Hello, ",
". How can I help you?",
"Did I miss anything while I was away?",
"Has anything interesting happened while I was gone?",
"What stories are the old sea dogs swapping over their rum these days?",
"What's the buzz in the taverns?",
"I'm looking for gossip, rumors, tall tales...anything I don't know may be of use.",
"Dish me up some of your freshest gossip, friend. There may be adventure or money to be found in even the smallest tidbit.",
"I still can't find...",
"It's impossible to find anything in this maze! Where is...",
"I'm as lost as a drunken navigator. Again!",
"You look like a local. Tell me where I can find...",
"Please tell me how to get to...",
"I've had a rotten day, so you'll save us both grief if you'll just tell me how to find...",
"I'd like your opinion on a local citizen.",
"I need to know whatever you can tell me about someone who lives here in town.",
"What can you tell me about...",
"Tell me whatever you can about one fellow...",
"I'm hoping you can tell me something about a person you may know.",
"This place isn't too big - I'll bet you know everyone who lives here. Let's talk.",
"Tell me about #sHavana#.",
"What can you tell me about this god-forsaken place?",
"I'd like to know more about this fine colony.",
"What's the story of this city and the island?",
"Do you know anything of interest about #sHavana#?",
"...",
"I'm sorry. I thought you were someone else.",
"I'm just passing through. So stand aside or be pushed.",
"What would you like to know, ",
"?",
"What interests you, captain?",
"What do you want from me?",
"Towns like this are always swimming with gossip. Give me the highlights.",
"Has anything interesting happened around here lately?",
"I just want to know what's going on in the neighborhood. Someone's swindled a friend? Someone's been killed? The innkeeper's really a woman? You get my drift.",
"How can I get to...",
"Can you help me find my bearings here in town?",
"Where can I find...",
"Can you tell me about someone I'm interested in?",
"I'd like some information about one local fellow. Could you help?",

"I'd like to know the history of your city.",
"I'd like to get some information about this colony.",
"I'm just walking here. I'll see you later.",

"What would that be, captain ",
"?",
"Let's hear it, ",
".",
"I'm listening, ",
".",
"What's the talk of the town these days?",
"What stories are the old sea dogs swapping over their rum these days?",
"It's been a long time since I've set foot on these shores. What have I missed?",
"Could you give me some directions?",
"I've gotten myself absolutely lost in these streets.",
"It's my first time in this city, and I'd like some directions.",
"I'd like your opinion on a local citizen.",
"I need to know whatever you can tell me about someone who lives here in town.",
"Could you give me some information about the locals?",
"Tell me about #sHavana#.",
"What can you tell me about this colony?",
"I'd like to know something about #sHavana#.",
"I've just realized I have to be somewhere. Goodbye.",
"Who do you mean,",
"?",
"Are you asking about someone specific?",
"Who exactly do you want to know about?",
"I mean the governor.",
"I am interested in the owner of the tavern.",
"The owner of the shipyard.",
"I'm talking about the local trader.",
"No one. Never mind.",
"He does his job, he does his job.",
"I see. I have another question for you.",
"Thank you, bye-bye.",
"I heard that Fadrique Castillo used to be a slave. He worked so well that his master freed him and even gave him some money. He used that to buy the tavern.",
"I see. I have another question for you.",
"Thank you, bye-bye.",
"Hmmm.. can't tell much about him I don't see him that often. But I think he does his job well.",
"I see. I have another question for you.",
"Thank you, bye-bye.",
"Señor Mendoza used to be a merchant captain until he retired and settled down here. He has done very well, as you can see from his fine clothes.",
"I see. I have another question for you.",
"Thank you, bye-bye.",
"Where are you headed, ",
"?",
"Not a problem, captain. Where do you need to be?",
"I'm happy to guide you, ",
". But where do you want to go?",
"How can I get to the tavern?",
"Where's the shipyard?",
"Where can I sell the goods I've brought with me?",
"Puh, thats a long way. Okay. From the port, turn right as soon as you pass through the gate. That should get you into the main town. Find the gallows, they're right in the middle of town. Stand by the steps and look for a door with barrels and crates outside. That's our tavern. And don't drink too much or you'll be back at the gallows!",
"Fine. Thanks for your time.",
"Where's the shipyard?",
"Where can I get a decent price for fine goods I've brought to town?",
"Head left on the city-entrance. You will see the shipyards sign, you can't miss it. ",
"I see. And the tavern?",
"Where can I get a decent price for fine goods I've brought to town?",
"I think that's everything. Thanks for your help.",
"The store is the big house with the balcony, on the main square. ",
"Where can I find the local shipyard?",
"How do I get to the tavern?",
"I see. Thanks for the information.",
"I'm not sure why you'd be interested, but why not?",
"What exactly are you interested in, ",
"?",
"Of course, ",
". Fortunately, it's a fairly short story.",
"I'm interested in the history of the colony...",
"Tell me about the colony.",
"Is there anything on the island besides the town?",
"I have a few more questions for you, if you don't mind.",
"I only know that #sHavana# was founded either 1514 or 1515. Sorry that I don't know more.",
"Thanks. Let me ask you a few more questions.",
"You know, I really thought that was going to be more interesting. Let me ask you something else.",
"That's all I need. Thanks.",
"Thanks for your time. Farewell.",
"There is a small village not far from our city.",
"What else can you tell me about the colony?",
"What else can you tell me?",
"#sHavana# was a important city for the Spanish conquistadores.",
"I see. What else?",
"What, apart from #sSantiago#?",
"In that case, maybe you can tell me more about the colony.",
"Got it. Let me ask you something else.",
"Do you know a boatswain named Fred Bob?",
"What can you tell me about the harbormaster?",
"Oh, Fred Bob? He's not a mutineer, I'll tell you that! He's a good mariner, and a strong man to have on your side when you're outnumbered. Pity about his imprisonment. We all hope the governor will release him, because no one but that pompous first officer believes he is guilty.",
"Interesting. Oh, I have another question for you.",
"Thank you very much, farewell.",
"I don't know how he does it, but our harbormaster makes it his job to know of every mariner in the archipelago.",
"I see. One more question, if you don't mind, please?",
"Thank you for your time. Bye.",
"Fred Bob? The boatswain? He's awfully hard to understand, but my brother knows him well. He's not a mutineer. That officer has it all wrong. We all hope the governor sets him free. He belongs on a ship, not in the stockade.",
"Fine man, excellent mariner. I don't believe for one minute that he threatened mutiny.",
"Ehm... I plumb forgot who I was going to inquire of. Just give me a second and it'll come back to me...",
"Who runs the smithy here?",
"That would be #sname#. #sfullname#. He started off as a slave working the bellows, so I've heard. Then the old blacksmith made him an apprentice and let him make small things. Just before he died, he granted #sname# his freedom and left the smithy to him.",
"That's quite a tale. Now I'd like to know something else.",
"He sounds as though he has plenty of experience. I'll have to see what he can do with my weapons!",
"My all-time best most favourite sword in the world here has gotten a bit dull as of late. To whom might I entrust it?",
"Remember how you found the gallows on the way to the tavern? A wagon is parked not far away. Round the corner from the wagon is the blacksmith's shop. It has a small cart outside.",
"Perfect! Seems I finally can polish my worn sword up!",
"Where's the shipyard?",
"Where can I get a decent price for fine goods I've brought to town?",
"To whom might I entrust my sword? Its once-fine edge has gotten a bit dulled.",
" We have a population of ",
" citizens.",
