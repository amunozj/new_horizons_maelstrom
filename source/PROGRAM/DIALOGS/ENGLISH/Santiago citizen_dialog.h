". Hola?, ",
"?",
"May I help you, ",
"?",
"Is this your first time in our city, ",
"? I haven't seen you before.",
"I'm ",
", captain and owner of the ship '",
"'. I've got some questions if you have a moment.",
"My name is ",
". I'd like to ask you some questions.",
"You can call me captain ",
". I'd just like some information.",
"Hello, captain ",
". What brings you to our colony?",
"Ah, captain ",
". ",
", it's you again. I hope your journey was a pleasant one. What's new?",
"Hello, ",
". How can I help you?",
"Did I miss anything while I was away?",
"Has anything interesting happened while I was gone?",
"What stories are the old sea dogs swapping over their rum these days?",
"What's the buzz in the taverns?",
"I'm looking for gossip, rumors, tall tales...anything I don't know may be of use.",
"Dish me up some of your freshest gossip, friend. There may be adventure or money to be found in even the smallest tidbit.",
"I still can't find...",
"It's impossible to find anything in this maze! Where is...",
"I'm as lost as a drunken navigator. Again!",
"You look like a local. Tell me where I can find...",
"Please tell me how to get to...",
"I've had a rotten day, so you'll save us both grief if you'll just tell me how to find...",
"I'd like your opinion on a local citizen.",
"I need to know whatever you can tell me about someone who lives here in town.",
"What can you tell me about...",
"Tell me whatever you can about one fellow...",
"I'm hoping you can tell me something about a person you may know.",
"This place isn't too big - I'll bet you know everyone who lives here. Let's talk.",
"Tell me about #sSantiago#.",
"What can you tell me about this god-forsaken place?",
"I'd like to know more about this fine colony.",
"What's the story of this city and the island?",
"Do you know anything of interest about #sSantiago#?",
"...",
"I'm sorry. I thought you were someone else.",
"I'm just passing through. So stand aside or be pushed.",
"What would you like to know, ",
"?",
"What interests you, captain?",
"What do you want from me?",
"Towns like this are always swimming with gossip. Give me the highlights.",
"Has anything interesting happened around here lately?",
"I just want to know what's going on in the neighborhood. Someone's swindled a friend? Someone's been killed? The innkeeper's really a woman? You get my drift.",
"How can I get to...",
"Can you help me find my bearings here in town?",
"Where can I find...",
"Can you tell me about someone I'm interested in?",
"I'd like some information about one local fellow. Could you help?",
"I'm wondering what people in town have to say about a certain person...",
"What can you tell me about #sSantiago#?",
"I'd like to know the history of your city.",
"I'd like to get some information about this colony.",
"I'm just walking here. I'll see you later.",
"Thank you. There is one more thing...",
"It was nice to chat with you. So long!",
"Anything else, captain ",
"?",
"Let's hear it, ",
".",
"I'm listening, ",
".",
"What's the talk of the town these days?",
"What stories are the old sea dogs swapping over their rum these days?",
"It's been a long time since I've set foot on these shores. What have I missed?",
"Could you give me some directions?",
"I've gotten myself absolutely lost in these streets.",
"It's my first time in this city, and I'd like some directions.",
"I'd like your opinion on a local citizen.",
"I need to know whatever you can tell me about someone who lives here in town.",
"Could you give me some information about the locals?",
"Tell me about #sSantiago#.",
"What can you tell me about this colony?",
"I'd like to know something about #sSantiago#.",
"I've just realized I have to be somewhere. Goodbye.",
"Who do you mean,",
"?",
"Are you asking about someone specific?",
"Who exactly do you want to know about?",
"I mean the governor.",
"I am interested in the owner of the tavern.",
"The owner of the shipyard.",
"I'm talking about the local trader.",
"No one. Never mind.",
"I heard that he works very closely together with the governor from #sHavana#. But that makes sense, I guess. Some people say he is afraid of an invasion from #sRedmond#.",
"I see. I have another question for you.",
"Thank you, bye-bye.",
"Sometimes he's even more drunk than some of his guests. That's really annoying! But most of the time he's a good guy.",
"I see. I have another question for you.",
"Thank you, bye-bye.",
"He made a lot of money, because of the important trading-knot, not far from here. Merchants often get attacked by pirates and buccaneers. I guess he didn't made all that profit if the people weren't convinced in his work.",
"I see. I have another question for you.",
"Thank you, bye-bye.",
"I don't go to the store that often, I like the market stalls more, so I don't know about him.",
"I see. I have another question for you.",
"Thank you, bye-bye.",
"Where are you headed, ",
"?",
"Not a problem, captain. Where do you need to be?",
"I'm happy to guide you, ",
". But where do you want to go?",
"How can I get to the tavern?",
"Where's the shipyard?",
"Where can I sell the goods I've brought with me?",
"OK. We will start in front of the governor's mansion. Turn your back to the mansion to face a square.  The tavern is at the far end on the left, it has a small set of steps.",
"Fine. Thanks for your time.",
"Where's the shipyard?",
"Where can I get a decent price for fine goods I've brought to town?",
"The shipyard is in the port area.  It is a three-storey building near the gate leading out of town. ",
"I see. And the tavern?",
"Where can I get a decent price for fine goods I've brought to town?",
"I think that's everything. Thanks for your help.",
"You have some walking to do! Go past the governor's house all the way to the big arched building.  From there turn right and look for a large brown building with awnings over the windows.",
"Where can I find the local shipyard?",
"How do I get to the tavern?",
"I see. Thanks for the information.",
"I'm not sure why you'd be interested, but why not?",
"What exactly are you interested in, ",
"?",
"Of course, ",
". Fortunately, it's a fairly short story.",
"I'm interested in the history of the colony...",
"Tell me about the colony.",
"Is there anything on the island besides the town?",
"I have a few more questions for you, if you don't mind.",
"Founded on the 25th of July, #sSantiago# was and still is an important port for the Spanish Armada.",
"Thanks. Let me ask you a few more questions.",
"You know, I really thought that was going to be more interesting. Let me ask you something else.",
"That's all I need. Thanks.",
"Thanks for your time. Farewell.",
"Well, we have #sHavana# on the other side of this island. Also this is the biggest island in the archipelago. I haven't walked through all parts myself yet so I can't give you much information about this.",
"What else can you tell me about the colony?",
"What else can you tell me?",
"#sSantiago# also is a big port for the slave-trading.",
"I see. What else?",
"No. You'll find a couple of plantations and houses on this part of the island, but it's largely undeveloped.",
"In that case, maybe you can tell me more about the colony.",
"Got it. Let me ask you something else.",
"Do you know a boatswain named Fred Bob?",
"What can you tell me about the harbormaster?",
"Oh, Fred Bob? He's not a mutineer, I'll tell you that! He's a good mariner, and a strong man to have on your side when you're outnumbered. Pity about his imprisonment. We all hope the governor will release him, because no one but that pompous first officer believes he is guilty.",
"Interesting. Oh, I have another question for you.",
"Thank you very much, farewell.",
"I don't know how he does it, but our harbormaster makes it his job to know of every mariner in the archipelago.",
"I see. One more question, if you don't mind, please?",
"Thank you for your time. Bye.",
"Fred Bob? The boatswain? He's awfully hard to understand, but my brother knows him well. He's not a mutineer. That officer has it all wrong. We all hope the governor sets him free. He belongs on a ship, not in the stockade.",
"Fine man, excellent mariner. I don't believe for one minute that he threatened mutiny.",
"Ehm... I plumb forgot who I was going to inquire of. Just give me a second and it'll come back to me...",
"How's that old metalworker Tomas fare these days?",
"You mean Tomasina, don'cha commandant gobeur? Ol' Tomas up and died not a while back, and it's his wife presidin' over the anvil now. Can't say she does a bad job of it, either.",
"Oh my... doesn't she come down with the vapours quite often in that profession? Nevermind; on to happier things.",
"Well. An elligible widow who can mend a blade? I shall have to pay my respects immediately...",
"My all-time best most favourite sword in the world here has gotten a bit dull as of late. To whom might I entrust it?",
"Our blacksmith works outdoors. Start from the town hall and head towards the big arched building. Just before the very first set of small steps, look for a stall on your left.",
"An open stall like a trader, then? I hope he can keep his furnace hot when the weather is cold!",
"Where's the shipyard?",
"Where can I get a decent price for fine goods I've brought to town?",
"To whom might I entrust my sword? Its once-fine edge has become a bit dulled.",
"Is there a tailor anywhere in #sSantiago#?",
"Look for the big arched building. You may see it on your way to the store. The tailor's shop is next to that, near the city wall.",
" We have a population of ",
" citizens.",
"My neighbour works in the governor's residence. She says ",
" isn't looking forward to the wedding at all, thinks the ",
" is cruel and arrogant. Poor thing! Almost makes you glad to be poor, at least you can marry who you love.",
"his daughter",
"his son",
"You missed the excitement. There was some shooting!",
"What happened?",
"Not much, actually. I heard the shot, looked at where it came from, but I didn't see a body. The soldier's gun must have gone off accidentally.",
"So it was a soldier who did the shooting?",
"Yes. Odd, though. He wasn't carrying a musket like all the other soldiers.",
