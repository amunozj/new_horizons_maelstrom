"I'd like to talk to you about a small piece of business.",
"I'm just here to pay my respects, #saddr#. Nothing more.",
"In that case, please leave my study and let me get back to more important matters.",
"Yes, of course. Sorry I disturbed you.",
"I'm sorry, but I don't have anything to talk about right now.",
"Oh yes? I have a proposition for you, captain.",
"Indeed?",
"I have learned that you completed the task successfully; my congratulations, captain! Here is your reward.",
"My thanks; It was a pleasure to aid you.",
"You must destroy the ",

"You shall not hear of her again, that I promise.",
"I'm afraid I can't help you.",
"I crave forgiveness, your Excellency.",
"I'm interested to learn about #sgov_nation# relations with other nations.",
"I'm looking for a Letter of Marque.",
"I've heard I'm up for promotion.",
"I can no longer serve ",

"I'm through serving ",

"Yes, I am.",
" does not take kindly to turncoats, ",
"Uh, never mind.",
"Very well. But I hope you will reconsider, in time...",
"Goodbye, ",
"Huh?",
"Tough.",
"What do you want, captain?",
"I'm Johan Elting, I work for Vice-Admiral Benavides. I must arrest a French corsair in Alice Town and Vice-Admiral Benavides said you could help me.",
"Can I know why you want to arrest this person?",
"She's a friend of Bartolomeu o Portugues and we want to use her to trap this Portuguese pirate.",
"I see. By the way, who is accompanying you ?",
"Nicholas Butcher, Excellency. He also works for Vice-Admiral Benavides.",
"Well, I have an English sergeant working for me. He often gives me some useful information about the military activities of that town.",
"He could help us for the mission.",
"Yes, avoiding any troubles with the guards of Alice Town.",
"Where can I find him?",
"Certainly patrolling the streets of that town. I'm going to send a messenger informing him of your arrival.",
"Thank you, Governor. I'll be back in your town with the prisoner.",
"Ha ! finally, you are back. This woman is your prisoner?",
"Yes, Governor. Captain Roxanne Lalliere herself. I need to lock her in a jail until Captain Padilla arrives.",
"Captain Padilla is to come in Puerto la Cruz? I didn't know...",
"Yes, he must arrive over the next days. He'll take Captain Lalliere in his galleon for more security.",
"There is of course a jail in the town but I recommend you let your prisoner in the jail of my fort.",
"Why?",
"Because there are a lot more soldiers in the fort. The second reason is the fort is isolated and easier to defend. There is only one path to reach the fort; path guarded day and night.",
"You're right, Governor. I'm going to take her there.",
", are you aware that you stand accused of murder? You were seen near the victim's body. What do you say in response to this charge?",
"It has nothing to do with me. The man was already dead when I entered the room! I was told he was only injured, and that he might have some important information for me.",
", I've just been told that a man was captured as he attempted to leave town with a blood-stained knife in his possession. He confessed to the murder you were accused of. You may go free immediately.",
"Thank you. I knew I could trust in justice here in #sEleuthera#.",
"Yes, Captain?",
"My respects, Governor. I'm here in order to know if you need my services.",
"Joaquim de Almeida, of course. I've heard you successfully fought the French on #sisland_Conceicao#. Do you work for the British against the French?",
"No, Sir. I was ambushed by the French Navy when they were preparing an attack on #sisland_Conceicao#.",
"I prefer that. As you know, we are at war with the British. In fact, I could need your help for an operation.",
"What kind of operation?",
"Captain Jean Lafitte, maybe you know, has been contacted by the British Governor of #sisland_Turks# so that he works for him.",
"He's above all a smuggler not really a privateer.",
"Yes, however, the British try to enlist all the experienced captains in the West-Indies for this war.",
"How did you know Captain Lafitte was contacted by the British?",
"He himself informed me. He prefers to be on the American side.",
"What is the relation between Captain Lafitte and the operation?",
"Well, Captain Lafitte informed me the British sent to #sisland_Turks# a warship full of troops and weapons to attack my settlement in the next very few weeks. The garrison of #sEleuthera# is limited. My soldiers could not stop a such attack. I need you set up an operation with Captain Lafitte to prevent this attack.",
"That's a risky operation.",
"If you succeed I'll pay you 25000 gold coins.",
"I was expecting more, Governor...",
"Unfortunately, I cannot pay more. The financial resources are very low. The war against the British has dramatically decreased the trade and the wealth of #sEleuthera#.",
"Alright, I agree to help you.",
"Sorry Governor, but I must decline your offer. Too dangerous for the money I can earn.",
"Very well! I knew I could count on you.",
"So, I suppose I need to meet Captain Lafitte as soon as possible.",
"Indeed. But, he isn't on the island.",
"Where is he?",
"In #sTortuga#. He tries to enlist more men for the operation. You should set sail for #sTortuga# in the next few hours and join him to plan the operation. Take this letter to inform him you work for me and you'll be his partner for this mission.",
"I'll do. Thank you, Governor.",
"Ha! Captain. Here you are! What about the mission?",
"Done, Governor! The ship has been sunk.",
"Wonderful news! This will definitively discourage the English to attack #sEleuthera#.",
"Certainly, Governor. The HMS Endeavour was the only ship available for a such operation.",
"Otherwise, don't worry I didn't forget you reward. Take these 25000 gold coins. I'll also pay Captain Lafitte in a short while.",
"Thank you, Governor.",
"In the future, come and see me again if you need some work.",
"I'll do, Governor.",
