"If I were you, captain ",
", I'd return immediately to my ship and sail far away from these shores!",
"And why should I do that?",
"Dear friend! You're always the welcome in this colony! How are you and what wind led you on this shore?",
" Can I hope that you bring us some smuggling goods you have taken to our enemies and you want to donate to our town?",
" Of course we'll pay you a good sum to assume your war damages. Our governor will be proud to be your friend! Believe me.",
" You could become an honoured citizen of the town! What do you think about that, captain?",
"Sorry but I have other engagements to honour.",

". I don't like ",
" bastards! I'll wait for you at sea! Farewell!",
"It will be your end.",
"Captain ",
" I presume! Our local governor is ready to close his eyes about some of your actions against our nation that we could call Piracy actions.",
" Our colony needs some type of goods to grow and prosper. Perhaps have you captured some smuggling goods during your actions.",
" If you agreed to sell them to our town with a cheap price, our governor could speak in your favour and improve your relations towards the crown.",
" People would look you more like a merchant instead of an... enemy! What do you think about that, captain?",
"Sorry but I have other engagements to honour.",
"I have this kind of goods in my hold. What's your proposition?",
"Sorry but I'm not interested.",
"Sorry but I don't have this kind of goods in my hold.",
"Captain ",
"! What winds led you to this cutthroat island?",
"Some personal business.",
"Your nation is an enemy of mine captain! I'll wait for you on sea! Farewell.",
"It will be your end.",
"Don't..disturb...me mate! I don't want to talk!",
"Keep sleeping matey..",
"You seems to be a captain! Our governor is always glad to offer his favours to able captains who can offer their help to our colony.",
" Our town needs some type of goods to grow and prosper. Perhaps have you captured some smuggling goods from our enemies during your actions.",
" If you agreed to sell it to our town at a cheap price, our governor could speak in your favour and improve your relations towards the crown.",
" People would regard you more like a merchant instead of an... enemy! What do you think about that, captain?",
"Sorry but I have other engagements to honour.",
"I have this kind of goods in my hold. What's your proposition?",
"Sorry but i'm not interested.",
"Sorry but I don't have this kind of goods in my hold.",
"Yes? What do you want, captain?",
"It seems you are sitting at our table! That's a problem between us! Are you captain of a ship? We could solve it at sea! How about a challenge?",
"Sorry for disturbing you, captain!",
"Good day, captain! What wind leads you to this cutthroat island?",
"Some personal business.",
"I'm the captain of a good ship and I will never be at peace as long as you remain on this Earth! I promise! I'll see you on the sea, Captain! Farewell!",
"We'll see!",
"We can offer you the sum of ",
" gold in exchange of all the smuggling goods you have in your hold!",
"Well. If that can improve relations between me and your country, why not?",
"Sorry but for this sum, I prefer to keep my goods! Farewell!",
"That's good, captain! The governor will be satisfied with this news and believe well that he will be grateful for that! Here's your money!",
"Thanks.",
"Yes, I'm the captain of a good ship! You can see her in the port and I serve the crown of this colony.",
"Your governor will see your body hanged on my mast from the shore! I'll await you on the sea, captain! Farewell!",
"Sorry for disturbing you, captain!",
"I'm a corsair of the king and I accept your challenge, #smister#! You'll regret what you said.",
"Ha! I'll sink you with pleasure!",
"But I'm only a single merchant who just wants to drink in peace! Why do you want to kill me? Help! Help! Is there somebody to help me?",
"Shut up, coward!",
"Not so fast, #sladlass#! ",
"You're supposedly #snation#, as am I.",
"You're supposedly friendly to #snation#, so we're not at war.",
" I know my own loyalty. So does the governor. If you attack me, you risk being branded a pirate.",
"You make a good point, captain. Let us continue to be allies and fight against our common enemies. Farewell and good hunting!",
"I don't care! My challenge still stands! Fight me at sea or forever be known as a coward!",
