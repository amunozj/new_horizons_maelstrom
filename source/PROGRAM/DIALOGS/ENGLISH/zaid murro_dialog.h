"Hey, buddy, can't you stop for a minute to chat a little?",
"Hello, hello. I can tell that you are a real sea dog like I am, so why don't we chat a little?",
"I am sorry, but I am in a hurry. Let's talk later.",
"Leave me alone. I am tired of you. Goodbye.",
"Who are you? I don't mind a little chat, of course, but I'd like to know at least your name.",
"My name is ",
", and I am captain of the '",
"'.",
"How many times do I have to repeat myself! I am ",
", and I am captain of the '",
"'.",
"I am sorry, but I am in a hurry, and I don't have time to talk to you.",
"I've no desire to reveal my identity, and besides, I don't have time for idle chat. So, be gone.",
"Oh! Captain?! So, is that your ship over there? Not bad, not bad...there is no comparison with our tub.",
"Don't you mind if I ask you what your name is?",
"What's your name, fellow?",
"Oh, I am sorry, captain. I am ",
" from the 'Juno'.",
"Great, ",
", and now we've been introduced, I've got some questions to you.",
"Now, when you know my name, and I know yours, can you finally answer my questions, or are you going to continue playing the fool?",
"I am sorry, I have to go now.",
"Let's end our conversation on that note.",
"I am listening to you, captain.",
"What's interesting going on in the town?",
"Let's end this idle talk and get down to business.",
"What's interesting...? Well, I don't even know what to tell you about. Everyone has his own interests – a trader is interested in one thing, a sailor in another. Well, I know that ",
"Claire Larrouse",
"Claire Larrouse",
" arrived in the town recently. They say she is making up a crew for her new expedition.",
"Hmm, I've never heard this name before.",
"I don't care about that. Let's talk business.",
"That's all I wanted to know.",
"Thank you. That's all I wanted to know.",
"Just that? These rumors you can hear on every corner. Good day.",
"Let's talk about more serious things now..",
"Gossip, gossip. Now it's time for a serious talk, ",
".",
"Captain, did you fall from the moon or what? She is a very famous swordsman and captain, and she is lucky as a devil.",
"Well, she is famous to some, but not to me. Where do you say I can find her?",
"Ha! I've heard of many a so-called swordsman who would slaughter a man in his sleep and call himself great. Well, where do you say she is staying?",
"Where else? Of course she is in the tavern or somewhere else about town. If I were you, I'd go to the tavern. if Claire is not there, she will come there soon.",
"Thank you. Now I want to talk business with you.",
"That's enough of this nonsense. Let's get down to business.",
"Thank you. I have to go now.",
"I'll go and talk with that fellow. Farewell.",
"What do you want to talk about?",
"How long ago did you come here to #sIsla Muelle#?",
"How long has your ship been lying in this port?",
"How was our sail?",
"Well, did you like sailing under my protection?",
"How is your business?",
"So, do you like being a tradesman?",
"Remind me please about your problem with bandits.",
"You told me once about your problem with bandits. Can you refresh my memory about that?",
"Some of those bandits who have been killing your animals are dead but there were too many of them in the camp\nDon't worry, I'll finish them off.",
"No one will bother you or your animals anymore.",
"No, nothing. Farewell.",
"God bless you! You helped me so much! I can't thank you enough. Take however this spyglass. I found it long ago in a galeons wreck. It served me well at sea and because I won't need it on land I want you to have it!",
"Your gift is most welcome! Don't worry. If you need anything in the future - just ask me.",
"Some bandits appeared recently on the island, and they are constantly killing my animals. I complained to the local authorities, but they pay no attention.\nI can handle myself well for a man of my age, but I think that there are about five of them, so I can't handle them all.",
"I think I can help you. Do you know where those bandits camp?",
"Only five people? You make too much of this problem. I'll teach them a lesson with ease! Do you know where those bandits camp?",
"What a shame! The authorities do nothing to protect their citizens? I hope the matter will be settled soon.",
"Five people? That's too many for me.",
"To tell the truth, things are not going well, captain.",
"What's the matter? Did you invest money in some unprofitable business?",
"Everything is fine with that, captain. I decided not to open a store, but to buy a cattle-ranch. You know, I grew up on the farm, so I know how to take care of the animals.",
"That's nice, but what's the problem?",
"To be a cattle-herder? Is that your life's dream? Well, well.... So, what's your problem, then?",
"Everything was good at first, but then some bandits appeared on the island, and they constantly kill my animals.\nI tried to complain to the local authorities, but they pay no attention.\nI can handle myself well for a man of my age, but I think that there are about five of them, so I can't handle them all.",
"I think I can help you. Do you know where those bandits camp?",
"Only five people? You make too much of this problem. I'll teach them a lesson with ease! Do you know where those bandits camp?",
"What a shame! The authorities do nothing to protect their citizens? I hope the matter will be settled soon.",
"So, you want me to go and kill those scoundrels? What times we live in!",
"Well, who knows? I guess somewhere in the jungle. Do you really want to help me? Then I want to repay you for your kindness. To be honest, I don't have much money\nbut I'll lose more money if they keep killing my livestock. When you kill them; return to me. Good luck!",
"Hey, no problem. Why not help a man in need?",
"I'll help you. I need a little exercise, anyway, and if you happen to have a little gold to spare, that would be fine, too...",
"That's wonderful, ",
"! It wasn't so long ago I felt safe here, and so did my friends.",
"Ah, it's nothing. By the way, where is your 'Juno'?",
"She has already put to sea, and I have already saved some money to open my own business ashore.",
"I see. Well, good luck. I hope to see you again.",
"So you've decided to become a tradesman? Well, well. All right, good luck.",
"Good luck to you, too, captain, and now it's time for me to leave.",
"Farewell.",
"Yesterday we delivered a cargo of paper from the French colony. Our captain prefers trade to all other ways of making money, so we sail back and forth in this archipelago.",
"How about pirates? Do they bother you?",
"So, how is it going? Are you afraid of the pirates?",
"Well, sometimes we are. Last time we barely escaped from the pirate brig, so now our captain is looking for an escort. Our ship is loaded, slow and not maneuverable.",
"You say you need an escort ship? How much would you pay for this service?",
"An escort ship, you say.... Well, how many coins will I will it put in my pocket if I agree to escort your ship?",
"What? I don't know. You'd better to ask the captain about that. He should be at the store right now.",
"I'll ask your captain. Thanks for your help.",
"All right, I'll talk to your captain.",
