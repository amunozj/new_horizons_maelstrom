"Weren't you taught manners? Can't you see that I'm talking to someone and don't care to be bothered by you.",
"Oh, I didn't want to disturb you. I'm sorry.",
"All right, calm down, to be honest I don't care about you either.",
"I'm sorry, aren't you ",
", captain of the 'Juno'?",
"Wait, are you ",
"? Do you command the 'Juno'?",
"I'm sorry, but I'm going to set sail soon and I don't have time to talk to you.",
"In that case I don't dare to delay you. Safe travels.",
"Then you should hurry, before something... unexpected happens to you.",
"I'm glad to see you again, I'd like to talk with you about one thing.",
"I'm listening, what do you want to tell me?",
"I've heard that you are looking for a reliable captain who can escort your ship during your voyage.",
"I've heard you need an escort. I can do it for you.",
"Oh, I'm so glad to see you again! To tell you the truth I felt very safe under your protection!",
"When are you planning to head back?",
"When are we going back, fat man? I can't wait to get my money.",
"So, we're back. Thanks for your help, ",
".",
"Are you satisfied with our cooperation?",
"Is that it? You don't need anything more from me? Then give me the coins.",
"All right, all right, I admit I got too excited, I shouldn't have jumped on you like that. Let me introduce myself, I'm ",
", captain of a merchant ship.",
"And my name is ",
". Well, it's seems we are colleagues - we're both captains.",
"They call me",
", ",
", you've probably heard of me.",
"Oh! I've heard about you! You're quite a famous captain, aren't you? I'd like to drink a mug of rum to that!",
"You flatter me. I'm glad to meet you too.",
"If I hadn't had urgent business elsewhere, I would have given my enemies some powder to smell!",
"I don't dare to bother you any more, senor ",
".",
"Mind your own business and don't poke your nose into my affairs and you'll be fine.",
"Yes, and whom do I have the honor of talking with?",
"My name is ",
". I've heard that you are looking for a reliable captain who can escort your ship during your voyage.",
"I've heard you need an escort. I can do it for you.",
"I don't doubt your courage, ",
", but I have to leave you now, I'm afraid.",
"I don't dare delay you.",
"For goodness sake, who said that am I against it?",
"I'd like to ask you to do me a favor. Would you be so kind as to spare me a couple of minutes?",
"Yes, of course, what's the matter?",
"It's not been so serene around here recently. Piracy casts a pall over these waters and I'm a little worried because my ship is old and not as swift it once was. Also, I don't have enough cannons to manage a defence.",
"So, you want my ship to provide protection in the event of a pirate attack?",
"Yes, I really need an escort and I can pay you 2500 gold. For that your ship will escort me to #sisland_Falaise de Fleur# and back.",
"Agreed, when do we set sail?",
"Deal. When are you going to start the journey?",
"No. I'll lose more money on this voyage than I'll make.",
"No, it's not enough money to risk my ship.",
"I can't accept your offer because I'm too busy right now.",
"I'm not interested.",
"The sooner the better. Once you've escorted me to #sisland_Falaise de Fleur# and back, I'll give you your money.",
"Fine, let me settle some of my personal affairs and I'll be at your disposal.",
"We have a deal. We'll sail as soon as I'm done with a few matters in town.",
"My ship is ready for the journey back. By the way, here is half the money I owe you.",
"Let's be on our way. May luck be with us.",
"What are you waiting for? Move it! I can't stay on this island forever.",
"Oh, yes! Thanks once again. Here is your reward\nToo bad that you've got your own ship. To be honest, I'd gladly hire you, because my navigator, ",
"Zaid Murro",
", has quit his job after this voyage.",
"C'est la vie. Well, if you need an escort or anything, I'm at your service.", // spell check by B.
"Yes, yes. Now I'm out of here.",
"Good, what do think about ",
"commerce",
"?",
"It's always a pleasure to deal with you. I'll do it.",
"Sure, I'm going to do that.",
"I have to refuse. My crew won't work for free.",
"I said I'm not going to work for you, so find someone else.",
"That's too bad then, I'll have to take the risk and start the journey myself. Good luck.",
"Good luck to you too, senor.",
"Bye.",
"Yes, I really need an escort, but I would prefer to sail with less satellites, you know.",
"I'm sorry to hear that. But I intended to get rid of some of my ships, and afterwards I could escort you, if you're still interested.",
"Don't run away, fat man! I intended to get rid of some of the fools, they call themselves my companions, afterwards we make a deal!", //minor spell check by B. 'themself' in stead of 'temself'. Pieter please correct!
