"Maybe you need an officer, captain?",
"An officer? And what can you do?",
"No, I have enough officers for now.",
"Well, people says I'm a good ",
". Hire me for your ship, captain, and you'll see for yourself.",
"How much do you ask?",
"Alas, I already have a ",
".",
"Did you change your mind, captain? Decide that it might be useful to hire a new ",
"?",
"Yes, perhaps. How much do you want?",
"You're wrong. Goodbye!",
"I think we'll agree on ",
" gold.",
"Isn't that too much for you?",
"I agree. Consider yourself hired.",
"You aren't worth that much. Farewell.",
"All right. I think then that I might agree to ",
" gold. How is that?",
"That's better. I welcome you to my crew.",
"I still think that is too much. Farewell.",
"Unfortunately, captain, I'm sure I'm worth what I'm asking. If it's too expensive for you - find someone else who will ask less.",
"Well... You're hired.",
"That's just what I'll do. Goodbye.",
"Thank you, captain. You won't regret that gold when you'll see me in action.",
"I hope so.",
"Hey, it looks like you're out of cash! Sorry, captain, but I don't work for credit.",
"Damn!",
"Let me finish my drink first, captain. But rest assured - I'll be aboard before we sail.",
"All right. If I have to wait for you - you be scrubbing the decks. Alone!",
"At your service, ",
"No, stand at ease.",
"You're fired. I don't need your services!",
"As you say, captain! But look - if you fire me, I will never return to your ship. So, you decide.",
"Well. I have changed my mind. I still need you.",
"Great! Get lost!",
"I told you, captain, I won't return. I have my own pride.",
"And I don't need you, either!",
"Next time we board, you're coming over with me.",
"Why don't you sit out the next boarding.",
"You bet!",
"So that's clear.",
"Fine, I'll keep busy chasing rats in the hold.",
"Stay here!",
"Follow me, and make it snappy!",
"OK.",
"Good, eh? How good?",
"Impressed, aren't you?",
"Very well, I'll tell the crew to hoist ",
" colors.",
"Thank you.",
"I am ready to follow you in a moment, I must only fetch my dunnage first. I'll meet you behind the next gate.",
"Great, I can do with reinforcements. Welcome to the crew!",
"Currently we're on ",
" food rations and ",
" rum rations. We have enough food for ",
" days and enough rum for ",
" days, at our current rations. Do you want to change the rations?",
"Yes, let's go to full food rations and normal rum rations.",
"Yes, let's go to half food rations and normal rum rations.",

"You'll need to divide the plunder first, captain ",
"Oh, never mind.",
"A salary!? Are you sure, #ssir#? That's not what the crew signed on for.",
"Yes, I am sure. And I don't care how many desert!",
"Sign articles!? Are you sure, #ssir#? That's not what the crew signed on for.",

"What colors shall we fly, captain?",
"Our current ",
"Pirate colors.",
"About the ship and crew...",
"About me...",
"About you...",
"Yes?",
"Never mind.",
"What's the status of our provisions?",
"We're done with privateering. Now you all will be payed a salary.",
"Let's sign articles.",
"Bring down our colors; we're flying a new flag.",
"What's our layed up ships status?",
"I don't seem to fit in quite right in this world...",
"I need to change my clothes.",
"You need a better uniform.",
"Mate, I'm afraid I no longer need your services. I'll have your sea-chest brought to the shore for you!",
"...",
"Are ye sure, cap'n? I'd like to stay on, if you'd have me!",
"Yes, I'm sure. But, you never know, I'd like to be able to find you if I need you again!",
"May we meet again soon, then. Fair winds and following seas, captain!",
"And to you.",
"What manner of pirate be ye, captain? Right now you're known as ",
" and we currently don't tell you about sightings unless we'll have a chance to defeat them.",
" and we currently tell you about all ships we spot.",
"I want to change standing orders regarding powerful enemy vessels.",
"Very well.",
" Now we won't bother you with too-powerful sightings.",
" Now we'll tell you about all sightings.",
"a",
"An ",
"A ",
"an ",
"a ",
"Right, as you wish. And shall we add some furnishings, fittings or equipment? That might be necessary to let the building perform a proper function.",
"No, just get the building done as it is.",
"Belay all that, I have to survey the building ground once again.",
"Yes, good idea!",
"So we'll erect a ",
" with a ",
"Right, get going!",
"Err, sorry, I'm not sure if that's a good design for this place. And what did you say about our resources?",
"Rise a ",
"My own colors.",
"Right here in front of you, yes? Aye, we have ",
" plank and brick units respectively, and ",
" gold to buy other materials. And may I remind you that you must detach some of our ",
" sailors to guard and maintain each building? So what would you like to erect?",

"Umm, do I understand you right? You'll erect any building I want? Right here? Does that make sense?",
"Belay that, I have to survey the building ground once again.",
"Whether that makes sense depends entirely on you. YOU are the architect of this building, the creator of this settlement. Whether you fancy a shipyard on a mountain, a forest in a townhall or a brothel in a church: I'll follow your orders and build it. But don't blame me if you waste your money on a misplaced ruin. There is only one limitation: we can't erect more than 15 constructions in one location. And if we squeeze too many houses into an already crowded town it may become overpopulated and certain characters may not appear anymore.",
"Hmm... hmm.. a brothel in a church? Who knows, might be a profitable idea.. But now let's go ahead with the construction here.",
"All right, and shall we arm this fortification?",

"On second thoughts, stay as you are.",
"Aye aye, captain!",
"Carry on then.",
"Mate, I'm afraid I no longer need your services. I'll have your sea-chest brought ashore, and here's the ",
" gold I owe you.",
"Tell me about the ships finances.",
"Yes #ssir#! We currently owe the crew ",
" gold, and the officers ",
". Based on the crew we have today we are paying out ",
" gold per month for the crew, and ",
" gold per month for your officers.",
"? Any orders?",
"I got a very special thing, it is said to help you. Would you please take it?",
"About...",
"We're doing a smuggling run right now and I need to know the coastguards' patrol schedule.",
"You could always ask some of the guards in the tavern, they might spill the information. But I could also take a look for you and report back when is the best time.",
"I will try my luck with the guards.",
"I like your thinking! Ask around, discreetly, scout the shores, whatever it is you do, and report back here in a day. And be careful.",
"Sorry, I wasn't able to find out the best time for smuggling. There were just too many guards.",
"So I've waited a whole day for nothing? Well, I guess you did the best you could.",
"I was able to gather some info and I think the best time to smuggle would be ",
"Okay, I'll be back tomorrow.",
"I just need to collect my dunnage. Go on ahead, I'll catch up with you as soon as possible.",
"It's time to spread a little cheer among the men and divide the plunder, ",
".",
"I am honored by your allowing me to serve you, captain. If you haven't sold your officers' ships, and all your goods and cannon, you should do so first and come back to me. As it stands, each crewman's share will be ",
" gold--I'm sure they'll be ",
"--and your share will be ",
" gold. The starting capital for your next venture will be ",
". You'll have to start recruiting your crew again. Are you sure you wish to divide the plunder, captain?",
"Yes.",
"No.",
"Very well. I am sure the crew will be ",
" with their shares. Good luck on your next expedition!",
"Thank you.",
"Aye Captain. I suppose at this time you just want to share out the gold?",
"Yes just divide up the gold, if you please. The crew are due to be paid regardless of our current situation.",
"Time to draw a line under this voyage and start planning a new adventure, I think.",
"Very well.  ",
"As it stands, each crewman's share will be ",
" gold--I'm sure they'll be ",

" gold. ",
"You will also have ",

"From now on you'll get a salary paid like the rest of my officers.",
