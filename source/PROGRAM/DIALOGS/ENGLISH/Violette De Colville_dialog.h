".",
"It's you! I was hoping I'd never see your face around here again.",
"Good day to you, too, ",
".",
"Guess it's not your lucky day, ",
"Would you like to see what I've got in stock?",
"Sure. Let's have a look.",
"Later. Right now, I need to talk.",
"Some other time.",
"Are we going to make a deal, or do you just want to buy some supplies?",
"I want to sell off some goods.",
"I'd like to buy some gear.",
"Nothing, thanks. Bye!",
"What do you want to talk about?",
"I'm listening.",
"I was asked to deliver some cargo to you.",
"Might you be in need of a captain, ma'am? I have an excellent ship, and I can deliver any cargo, anywhere you like.",
"I've got no time to talk right now.",
"No, I don't need your services. Not while you're sinking #snation_desc# ships.",
"In that case, goodbye.",

"Oh, sorry.",
"You've remembered your assignment a bit too late, don't you think? I'll take the goods anyway, but don't expect to be paid. Pay closer attention next time! Goodbye.",
"Farewell.",
"Oh! I've been waiting for it for a long time. Here is your reward, my good ",
"Always welcome.",
"Sadly, I have no need of your services at the moment.",
"I'm sorry to hear that. Let's discuss something else then.",
"I refuse to trade with a person of your reputation and relations. Now get out, ",
", before I call the guards.",
"Very well.",
"Yes, I'm expecting #squantity# cwt of #scargo#. Do you have it?",
"Umm... some of it appears to have been misplaced. Don't worry, I'll replace what was lost and bring it to you!",
