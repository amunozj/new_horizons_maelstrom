"Oi, #slad#, you look like an experienced sea dog! Buy me a cup o' rum, will ya?",
"I'm not feeling particularly charitable at the moment.",
"Sure. And I'll join you.",
"Hey! Do you wanna play some dice? I recently came back from a very successful expedition, so I've got money to lose!",
"Really? You don't look like it.",
"Don't distract me from my drink!",
"...",
"Don't even look my way! You've got a reputation as the best dice player on these islands. I'm not risking it.",

"All right, sure. Let's play.",
"Maybe some other time.",

"And what would that be? Your moth-eaten coat?",
"No, no, no - I've still got some loot left. Look here!",
"All right - let's see what you're hiding.",
"Well...I can't show you here. I've rented a room nearby, though. Let's go there.",
"No, thanks. Some other time.",
"Okay. I'm probably going to regret this, but you've got me curious. Let's take a walk. ",
"Innkeeper! Keep this table free until we get back!",
"Nobody's going to take it. Let's go.",

"Well, she is beautiful...",
"Too right, she is! But a game's a game.",
"All right. Let's play.",
"How dare you make such a wager?!",
"Ah, good! We play by the standard rules! 100 gold pieces a round!",
"Fine, you stake the girl against my 100 but let's do it here. You have the dice?",
"I do. I'll roll first... ",
"!!!",
"My turn. I got... ",
"! You lose, lad!",
"Blast it! What happened to my luck? All right, take the girl and go!",
"With pleasure.",
"What?",
"You filthy pig! You don't deserve to live!",
"Are you trying to trick me? Well, it won't work!",
"Are you looking for trouble? You've found it!",
"Let's do it! I bet ",
"I'll back that up. Throw your dice.",
"I won't play.",
"Enough! I'm not playing with you anymore.",
"As you wish. I'll go find someone else to play with.",
"! I've seen better throws. Your turn.",
"! Not the best throw, but we'll see how you do.",
"! Not bad, not bad! You'll need to do better, though.",
"! I'm hot today!",
"Gimme the dice.",
"! ",
"You've lost, lad!",
"Take it. But I bet I'll win this time!",
"All right, you win. But I'm not playing anymore.",
"! ",
"You won! Dash it all! All right, one more time.",
"Try it, you won't win anyway.",
"Not this time.",
"Hmm. A draw. I hate draws. Once more?",
"Sure. Throw the dice.",
"No, I don't want to push my luck.",
"Now, this I like! So, will ya buy me a cup o' rum?",
"Certainly. Innkeeper! Rum!",
"You're a true friend! Cheers to us!",
"Whoa. Strong stuff!",
"To your health, and your generosity!",
"Cough-cough-cough.... That's smooth! Well, I've got to be moving on. See you around.",
"Let's have one more cup.",
"Twist my arm! Okay, why not?",
"Innkeeper! More rum!",
"You...you're trying to get me drunk and steal my money!",
"Settle down! I'm your friend, remember?",
"Shut up, rat, before I run you through!",
"Listen, you're a good #sgender#. Maybe you can help me with...a certain situation?",
"No. I have to be going.",
"Of course! We're friends, right?",
"...And then I grabbed the blade of his sword and...",
"...and she says to me, she says...",
"Cheers! Ah, who's this?!",
"Huh? What? Where?",
"The thing is, you see, one of the soldiers insulted me...yeah!",
"Soldiers? No, no. I think I'll pass.",
"Insulted?! Where is he? Lead me to him!",
"You're not my friend! No! You want...to...you want to kill me! That's right - to kill me!",
"All right, I see you've had enough for today. So long!",
"What? I don't want to kill you! Stop saying that, or I'll cut your head off!",
"Help! Get him off me!",
"Relax, this won't hurt!",
"Argh! I'll butcher you like a pig!",
"We'll see about that!",
"You're so stubborn! Come here, or I'll complain to your master and you'll be out in the street!",
"You're drunk, you pig! You're lucky I don't want to get my hands dirty by teaching you a lesson!",
"What?! It's me who's going to throw you out!",
"Where did you get a sword? I'll show you!",
"The only thing you can show anyone is how to make a fool of yourself! Get up out of that chair, and we'll see if you can handle me!",
"I don't play for THAT little. Raise it.",
"What are we betting?",
"I changed my mind...",
"I've got ",
"! Hmm... Let's look at your cards...",
"... Surplus. Maybe next time. Let's try that again...",
"... Lady luck's a tart tonight. Let's play one more time...",
"... Open your cards...",
"... Lucky man.",
"... Hah! Surplus for you. Maybe you should cut down on the albatross?",
"What are we playing?",
"However...",
"If you always play like that I'd gladly go for a rematch! You like my purse, don't you, coins? Yes, you do! Haha!",
"You won't be so lucky next time.",
"You are a great player. Cardsharp, maybe... I don't care... I'll be more careful with you in the future...",
"Ha! We learn from our mistakes... Good luck...",
"You are a good player. You have a sharp memory... With you - I'll play with pleasure any time here.",
"Thanks for the game... Good luck.",
"So you are doubling up! Aye, give me a card and let's see if it brings you any luck!",
"Alas, I don't have enough money to double up",
"! You lose, lass!",
"You've lost, lass!",
"... Lucky girl.",
"Do you want to raise your bet or shall we reveal our cards?",
"That's enough raising. Let's show those cards!",
"Well I have just one thing of value left to wager.",
"What is it this time?",
"A transferrable invitation to the poker tournament in #sGrand Turk#.",
"I've heard of the event of course but what's the invitation really worth?",
"To gamblers such as ourselves it's priceless, not only to test your skill but maybe to win the prize money and coveted trophy!",
"Ok. I'm game then, roll those dice again.",
"Right and may lady luck finally be on my side...",
" you lose again. I'll take the invite, I don't think the competition would have suited you anyway.",
"No, I've had enough of this. Just leave the room while you can, and leave the girl here.",
