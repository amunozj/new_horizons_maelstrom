"Go away before I call the guards!",
"As you wish.",
"No need to shout. I'm leaving!",
"What can I do for you, ",
"?",
"How can I help you, ",
"?",
"What do you want with me, captain?",
"I'd like to see your wares.",
"I must leave. Goodbye.",
"I'd like to do business with you...",
"I've brought the money as agreed. Where is ",
"Sabine Matton",
"?!",
"My men will bring her here. Show me the money.",
"Fine. My boys will bring her in. Meanwhile, show me the gold.",
"Why don't I keep the girl AND the gold?",
"You've brought it, eh? Well, hand it over and go. The girl stays with me.",
"Be gone! I have no business with you!",
"As you wish.",
"Hmph!",
"Have you seen my daughter? She's gone missing. They say she was last seen at the port.",
"No, I haven't seen her.",
"Perhaps she's run off with some lad.",
"Yes, I've got some information about that.",
"Of course I've seen her. I can even tell you where she is.",
"Yes, what can I do for you?",
"I'm in need of gold right now, and I'm looking for work. Anything I can help you with?",
"I'm listening.",
"I was asked to deliver some cargo to you.",
"Would you, perchance, be in need of a captain, sir? I have an excellent ship, and I can deliver any cargo, anywhere you like.",
"I've spoken with your debtor. He simply doesn't have the gold to pay you.",
"Your debtor just doesn't have the gold to pay you.",
"Your debtor refuses to pay. If you want your money back, I think you'll have to resort to...other methods.",
"Your debtor, this ",
"Baldewyn Coffier",
", refuses to pay.",
"Your debtor told me he'll bring you the money he owes today.",
"Smile. I've persuaded your debtor to pay. He promised to bring the money today.",
"I've carried out that assignment you gave me. Here's your money.",
"Here's your money. I've done my part of our deal.",
"A man named ",
"Baldewyn Coffier",
"Baldewyn Coffier",
" asked me to give you this money.",
"Someone named ",
"Baldewyn Coffier",
" was kind enough to hand over this gold for you.",
"I've spoken with your debtor. I think you're pushing him too hard. Give him time to start his own business, and he'll pay you back for sure.",
"Your debtor, ",
"Baldewyn Coffier",
" is a good man. Don't push him, and he'll pay you back sooner or later.",
"I've delivered your cargo to #sRedmond#.",
"Your cargo is in #sRedmond#, ",
".",
"I need to talk to you about that cargo you wanted delivered to #sRedmond#.",
"Well, you see...the cargo you wanted me to deliver to #sRedmond#...",
"I've got your cargo from ",
"Thomas O'Reily",
"Thomas O'Reily",
" in my hold.",
"Thomas O'Reily",
" has hired me to deliver some cargo to you.",
"I took your daughter where you asked me to take her. I also have this letter for you.",
"I took your daughter where you asked me to take her.",
"I took your daughter where you asked me to take her.",
"Your girl is now safe in #sIsla Muelle#.",
"I've got news about your daughter.",
"You know, I've been thinking. You're a wealthy merchant and a loving father. Why don't you pay me a few thousand in gold in exchange for the girl?",
"Sorry, I've got to be on my way.",
"How is she? Where is she? Please, tell me, I beg of you!",
"Your daughter has run away. She's on my ship as we speak.",
"Your girl has run off. She's on my ship.",
"Your daughter is on my ship now. I'm sure you'll gladly pay me 5000 gold to see her again.",
"Your girl is in my hands. If you don't want to see her harmed, you'll pay me 5000 gold.",
"She did what?! I'll teach her a lesson when I get my hands on her!",
"I'd calm my anger if I were you, and think about the reasons your daughter felt she could no longer live with you.",
"That'll teach her not to defy her parents! She wanted adventure, she got it!",
"You're right, and I know what I am going to do!",
"Fine, I'll have your daughter brought to you.",
"I'll order my men to bring your daughter ashore. Then she's your problem again.",
"You'll regret that!",
"You may well be right, but life is risk and I think she will make a fine officer in my crew.",
"You're not the first to threaten me like that but your daughter still becomes an officer on my ship.",
"Here's the money - exactly 5000 gold. Now where is my daughter?",
"Be calm. She'll be with you soon.",
"Simmer down! I've told you my men will bring her soon!",
"I've changed my mind. I'm taking the money and the girl.",
"Ha! Now that I have the money, you'll never see your daughter again!",
"My dear, are you all right?! This ruffian didn't hurt you?",
"There's a nice sight. A family reunion. I'll just leave you to it.",
"Spare me the tender reunion, or I might just change my mind.",
"So, you're holding my daughter captive aboard your ship. How much do you want for her freedom?",
"Not too much for a loving father to pay. A mere 5000 gold.",
"I want 5000 gold. What do you say?",
"All right. Bring my daughter here and you'll have your money.",
"As you wish.",
"Very well. She'll be here soon.",
"No. We'll meet outside of town, on the beach. It's safer that way.",
"What kind of a fool do you take me for? You'll bring the money to the beach outside of town in two hours, and then maybe I'll let you have your little girl!",
"...All right. In two hours, at the beach outside of town.",
"And don't try anything foolish!",
"And don't try to set me up, or you can kiss your little girl goodbye!",
"What a fool you are! Guards, Guards!",
"Blast you! Well, I'll take my leave before the guards arrive but that's the last you see of your daughter, she'll join my officers willingly enough.",
"I see you've handled your task admirably. Now that my daughter is safe and you've gained my trust, we can talk real business.",
"What business would that be?",
"Well, spit it out then!",
"I'm sorry, I have other concerns at the moment.",
"Maybe later. I need a break from you and your assignments - hang a few men, spill some blood. We'll talk again.",
"I'm not falling for your tricks. You demanded a ransom for my beloved daughter! Get out, pirate scum!",
"That's a shame. Goodbye.",
"You may have money, but you're no better than me!",
"...",
"I've got no work for you at the moment, but I would ask a favor of you.",
"What kind of favor?",
"I have a daughter. I believe you've already met her.",
"Yes, I did. She seems a fine girl. But what exactly do you want from me?",
"Since her mother left it has been difficult bringing her up on my own.",
"Surely a wealthy merchant like you doesn't need my sympathy?",
"No, but #sSabine# is of an age where a woman's touch in her life is essential.",
"Maybe so, but again, what's that to do with me?",
"I want you to conduct her to where I've decided she will get the guidance she needs.",
"I don't run an escort service. Why don't you take her yourself?",
"No, no. I can't leave my shop... or I'd risk losing my business but since you've met her I thought you might see your way to helping me.",
"Perhaps but I would need to know more details before I can decide.",
"Specifically, I want you to take her to #sIsla Muelle#, to her godmother ",
"Sylvie Bondies",
"Sylvie Bondies",
".",
"All right. I'll do it as a favor to you.",
"And how much would you pay me for this?",
"Sorry, I can't do it.",
"Well, I was hoping that you'd do it as a favor to me. But since you've mentioned payment, I suppose 1500 gold would be more than fair.",
"Agreed. Give me the money and consider it done.",
"No. I'm afraid I can't do it.",
"Here's your money. Keep my daughter safe until she reaches #sIsla Muelle#.",
"You have my word on that.",
"Like I said, take my daughter to her godmother, who lives on #sisland_Isla Muelle#. Her name is ",
"Sylvie Bondies",
"Sylvie Bondies",
". \nShe's French, but she's lived on the island for the past several years. Give her this letter when you arrive there.",
"How will I find this woman in such a big town?",
"Oh, it's quite simple. As you enter the town, go down the stairs to your right, then straight until you see another stair. \nClimb it and the one after it, then turn left. Go straight until you have a house in front of you. The door you're looking for is the one to the right.",
"Good, I'll leave right away then. Tell your daughter to wait for me on my ship, '",
"'.",
"Very well. I'll have to find someone else then.",
"Goodbye.",
"There's something else I'd like to discuss.",
"I see you've handled it well. Here's your share.",
"You don't seem too happy about it. Why is that?",
"Why the sour look?",
"I beg your pardon, but I've got to go now.",
"You know something? I couldn't be less interested. Do me a favor and wait 'til I'm out of here to flap your gums.",
"May I ask you a couple of questions?",
"I want to talk to you.",
"Finally! I thought he'd never pay me back.",
"Excuse me, but I've got to go now.",
"Now that your affairs are settled, I'm going to take care of my own. Goodbye.",
"May I ask you a couple of questions?",
"I want to talk to you.",
"Yes, yes, he already brought the money.",
"If that's true, I want my reward.",
"But you don't seem happy. Why?",
"Because I hate him! I utterly hate him and I want to ruin him. He was almost in my power - all that remained was to put him in jail for his debts. But somehow he slithered free...",
"What did he do to make you hate him so?",
"That's none of my business. Goodbye.",
"It's none of your business!",
"All right, all right, settle down. I'm leaving.",
"Let's change the subject. Can I ask you a couple of questions?",
"Of course, here's your money. You earned it.",
"I must go now.",
"May I ask a couple of questions?",
"You know, ",
", I can't see how it's any of your business.",
"As you wish, but I thought you were a better man than this.",
"Really? And I thought the old fox saw the tension between #snationR# and #snationF# as his chance to trick me.",
"As you can see, he didn't. Let's unload it - I don't want to stay here longer than necessary.",
"Of course, ",
". It shouldn't take long.",
"I hope you're right.",
"Well, we're finished, ",
". Thank you for the safe delivery. Good luck to you.",
"Goodbye.",
"Yes?",
"I've delivered your cargo to #sRedmond#.",
"I'm sorry, but I couldn't deliver your cargo to #sRedmond#.",
"No, I don't need your services. At least as long as you're sinking #snation_desc# ships.",
"In that case, goodbye.",
"I'm sorry, but I don't have anything for you at the moment.",
"I'll come back later, then.",
"I'm sorry, but your ship lacks the capacity for the assignment that I have in mind.",
"I'll come back later, then.",
"Oh! I was just going to ask you to do me a favor. Thing is, I need some cargo delivered to ",
", and as soon as possible. If you manage to do it in a month's time, you'll receive ",
" gold when you arrive. How do you like this offer?",
"I definitely like it.",
"I can't accept it.",
"I already told you today that I don't have anything for you.",
"Oh, sorry.",
"You've remembered about your assignment a bit too late, don't you think? I'll take the goods anyway, but don't expect to be paid. Pay closer attention to time next time! Goodbye.",
"Farewell.",
"Oh! I've been waiting for it for a long time. Here is your reward.",
"Always welcome.",
"No, I don't have any work for you at the moment.",
"I'll come back later, then.",
"I've already given you a job. I'm not giving you another until you show me you can finish what you start.",
"I'm sorry. You're right, of course.",
"You should be ashamed of yourself! ",
"Thomas O'Reily",
" has sent me a letter that clearly describes how you tried to swindle him.",
"Wait! I can explain everything.",
"Yes, I know. ",
"Thomas O'Reily",
" has already sent me a letter and informed me that you tried to steal from me.",
"Please! I can explain everything!",
"Keep your explanation. Let's see: as a result of your machinations I have lost 1500 gold. Compensate me for my loss, and I'll forget about this unfortunate incident - this time.",
"I don't have that kind of money!",
"All right, here's your money. I'm honest enough to pay for my mistake, and I swear I'll not repeat it.",
"What?! Get out before I call the guards! I will never do business with you again.",
"Ha! I'm so-o-o worried about this!",
"Perhaps you're wiser than I thought. See that this doesn't happen again.",
"Of course it won't, ",
".",
"Ah, you came just in time! I've got some cargo that needs to be in #sRedmond#. The pay is 600 gold.",
"Wait. Isn't England at war with France?",
"It's a deal, ",
".",
"I'm sorry, but I don't have enough room in my hold to take the job.",
"All right, I'll come back later.",
"My business can't wait for the war. Believe me, this trip won't be any more risky than usual.",
"What's the cargo?",
"That's easy for you to say, safe on dry land. The risks are much higher than usual. Naturally, I'll want a bigger payment.",
"You're sharper than my usual partners.... All right. I suppose I can raise your payment to 800 gold, but no more.",
"All right. What kind of cargo is it?",
"No, no, no. I've sent ships to #sRedmond# before, and all went smoothly. 600 is my final offer.",
"All right, fair enough. What's the cargo?",
"Sorry. The money isn't worth the risk. Goodbye.",
"Well, since we're partners now, let me introduce myself. My name is ",
".",
"My name is ",
".",
"Well, since we're partners now, let me introduce myself. My name is ",
".",
"My name is ",
".",
"The cargo is 100 tons of cacao. Deliver it to Thomas O'Reily, the shopkeeper on #sRedmond#.",
"I'll do it.",
"Do you have merchandise to sell, or do you just need some personal items, captain?",
"I'd like to sell the cargo I've brought.",
"I want to buy a couple of things for myself.",
"We won't trade at all. Goodbye.",
"Excellent, excellent! To be honest, I wasn't sure I'd get this cargo through - the dreaded war...",
"Haven't you forgotten something?",
"Oh, yes, the money. Of course. Here you go. I hope we can work together in the future.",
"We'll see about that. For now, I've got to go. Goodbye.",
"Yes, I do have some problems I'd like to solve as soon as possible.",
"What kind of problems?",
"You see, ",
", I sometimes loan money to people that need it.",
"So you're a trader AND a loan shark.",
"Loan shark is such an unpleasant term. I see nothing wrong with what I do. So - a man named ",
"Baldewyn Coffier",
"Baldewyn Coffier",
" took a loan of 2500 gold from me some time ago, and now it's time to pay back,\nbut he claims he can't pay me because he's broke!\nI'm certain he has the money. He just doesn't want to pay me. In fact, I've heard he tried to lure some lad into a shady enterprise, promising piles of gold.\nThank God he didn't succeed, but who knows how many unsuspecting fools he's already swindled?",
"I get it, I get it. I'll go and beat the money out of him right now...",
"Not so fast, ",
". If you manage to get my money back, you'll get your share of it. Say, twenty percent...",
"That would come to 500 gold? Not bad for such a simple job. It's a deal.",
"Only 500 gold? With respect, ",
", I don't think that's particularly generous.",
"Well, all right. I'll give you thirty percent. That would come to 750 gold.",
"Deal.",
"On the contrary, I think it's TOO generous for such a menial task, and I'm not going to pay any more!",
"With your reputation, you should be happy to get what I'm offering. A person like you could easily take my money and disappear. 500 gold, no more!",
"Fine, then. But bear in mind this will be the last time I work for such a small fee.",
"Ridiculous. I don't open my eyes in the morning for such a pitiful fee. Goodbye.",
"Suit yourself. I'll just find someone else. Plenty of free captains around here.",
"Goodbye.",
"Yes, well...you know, I think I'll take the job after all - every gold piece counts!",
"Excellent! Now go and find that scoundrel. He's usually wandering about town or lurking in the tavern, looking for the next simpleton he can cheat.",
"I'll be back soon - I don't think this'll take much time.",
"Very well. You leave me with no choice but to make an official complaint and see him arrested for his debts!",
"That's your problem. Do as you wish.",
"Why didn't you do that in the first place? Why this song and dance about getting back your money?!",
"Wait, don't go yet!",
"What?",
"Sorry. I've got other business to take care of and no more time to chat with you. Goodbye.",
"Well, you see...in order to make an official complaint, it needs to be signed by the injured party - that would be me - and at least one witness.",
"And you want me to be that witness? Forget it. I'm not going to be a part of this.",
"What's in it for me? My testimony isn't free.",
"You'll get the same money I promised you to collect the debt.",
"Well, that is a decent offer for a small thing. I agree.",
"Double the money, and perhaps we can talk.",
"Well, that's too bad. I was counting on you.",
"Goodbye, ",
".",
"I have a few questions for you.",
"Excellent. I've already written out the complaint. If you'll just sign right here...",
"Done. Now give me my money and I'll be off.",
"Done. Now I've got a few questions for you.",
"All right, I'll double the money. That would make it ",
" gold. I've already worked out the complaint, so if you'll please sign here...",
"Done. Now give me my money and I'll be off.",
"Done. Now I've got a few questions for you.",
"That's too bad. I thought we could do business.",
"Goodbye, ",
".",
"Wait! I agree to your offer.",
"And what exactly are you thinking of?",
"That sounds ominous for her. What are you thinking of?",
"Really? I didn't think I would ever see it!",
"I've just captured this rat trap so if you want to keep your head never mind your store better mind your manners",
"Of course, of course. Just take a look at my stock. Help yourself.",
"I thought the old fox saw the tension between #snationR# and #snationF# as his chance to trick me.",
"Before you start ",
"She is already learning lessons on my ship.",
"What do you mean by that?",
"Simply she'll grow up fast on my ship and I will make her an officer.",
"Well that's just fine and it absolves me from any responsibility.",
"Exactly. So it's agreed.",
"But I have your cargo from ",
"Yes, I'm expecting #squantity# cwt of #scargo#. Do you have it?",
"Umm... some of it appears to have been misplaced. Don't worry, I'll replace what was lost and bring it to you!",
"Really? And I thought the old fox saw all the pirate attacks on #snation# ships as his chance to trick me.",
"I thought the old fox saw all the pirate attacks on #snation# ships as his chance to trick me.",
"But someone else has business with you. I have been asked to deliver some cargo here.",
