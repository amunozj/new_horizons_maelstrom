"#shello#, #scaptain#. We almost thought that you were skewered by your own rapier!",
"As you can see, I am still alive. And if we want to stay alive, we should get off this island as soon as possible. I just escaped from jail and killed a couple of soldiers. They want my head on a plate!",
"Yes, the crew already found out you were imprisoned. After they put you in jail they came to confiscate the ship. And now it is lying in #sHavana# port under guard of the fortresses guns.",
"#smygod#, now what?",
"There is an English smuggler ship moored in Bahia de San Antonio. With a bit of luck, most of her crew will be getting drunk in the taverns.",
"No time to waste then! Let's go.",
"There it is, #scaptain#, the 'Sea Horse'.",
"Good, now we should wait for nightfall. They will not expect being attacked if they are drunk...",
"Alright, #scaptain#, I shall tell the man to wait.",
"Shouldn't be long.",
"It is dark now, the crew is ready, shall we board her, #scaptain#?",
"#sassault#. But be quiet. It should be a surprise!",
"#scaptain#, the ship is ours!",
"Haha! Weight anchor, and set sail!",
"#shello#, #scaptain#! As soon as we heard you were in prison, we thought of a way to get you out of there.",
"Quite a pleasant surprise. I thought I was going to be hung in the morning. But isn't this a bit drastic?",
"Perhaps we shouldn't have knocked down the door and killed the guards in front of the door, but we didn't really have another plan. We should flee immediately, otherwise we all will be hung!",
"You are right, now get me out of here.",
"#scaptain#, what should we do now? Those Spaniards will be looking for us everywhere!",
"#syes#, but they wouldn't search for us in a church. Let's go there.",
"#scaptain#, what is your plan of action?",
"We are going to take a look at Buca de Yuman, I want to know what the situation is. But just to be sure, let's take some men with us.",
"Prepare the ship. We are taking her by sea. I want to be done with this, before it is too late.",
"We have boarded her, Captain! Are we going to take her?",
"No, we are going to blow this ship up. That is why I need you here at the rudder. I will go to the powder room to set it alight. As soon as I am off, you steer away from the Vogelstruijs. And do NOT wait for me!",
"Aye, aye #scaptain#!",
