"Ah, a new face in my tavern! Welcome, dear ",
"!",
"Glad to meet you. My name is ",
".",
"Save your courtesy for someone else. I, ",
", don't need it.",
"You're a true #snoble#. A rare thing around here. My name is ",
". What brings you here?",
"If you don't like my smile so much, maybe I'll take it somewhere else. ",
"Strictly business.",
"Well, aren't we impressed with ourselves? I'm only sorry I don't have time to cut you down to size.",
"Business? You find yourself in the finest tavern on our archipelago! Leave that stern look at the door and have a drink!",
"Eh. Your business is your business. Unless I can get you a drink?",
"Quite right. Pour me some of your best wine.",
"I'll have wine, but not the dishwater you sell your regular customers.",
"Alas, I can't spare the time. Goodbye.",
"Drink that poison you pass off on your guests? I value my health too much. Good day!",
"For only one gold you can get the best wine you've ever tried in your life!",
"2 gold, and I'll see what I can do for you.",
"All right, I'm in a gambling mood. But I want more than wine for this gold. I'll need some information, too.",
"Here's your money, but keep your wine. I'd rather you just answered some questions for me.",
"Looks like I can't afford anything from your wine cellar. How about some rum?",
"I'm surprised you have the gall to ask money for that swill. Just bring me some rum!",
"Rum is also 1 gold. You don't have the money, that's not my problem.",
"What, are you still here? You can't afford the 2 gold for rum, either...",
"All right, bring your wine. Then you can answer a couple of questions for me...",
"Damn, it's daylight robbery! Bring the wine and answer my questions.",
"Too bad.",
"I'm certain I'll live another day without your wine.",
"So, how can I help you?",
"I'd like to talk business with you. Very important business...",
"Do you have a free room? I'd like to stay here for some time.",
"Do you have any rooms left in this fleabag tavern?",
"I need some information about this city.",
"I'm sorry, but the room is already taken by captain ",
"Amiel Berangere",
".",
"Damn! I've got to sleep somewhere!",
"I have a room. How long will you need it?",
"Just 'til morning.",
"I just need a place to rest my eyes until tonight.",
"It'll cost you 5 coins.",
"Here's your money.",
"Well, it appears the luxury of a comfortable bed is out of my grasp at the moment. I'll spend a night in the tavern hall.",
"For what?! This entire building? Forget it. I'll spend the night in the tavern hall.",
"All right, I'll think about it.",
"It'll cost you 5 gold coins.",
"Here's your money.",
"Well, it appears the luxury of a comfortable bed is out of my grasp at the moment. I'll spend a night in the tavern hall.",
"What, is it a king-size room? No, thanks. I'll sit in the tavern hall.",
"All right, I'll think about it.",
"I'd like to ask you a couple of questions.",
"I don't know the city very well. Can you help me?",
"I'm looking to hire a crew.",
"I need to find the local shop.",
"My ship is in need of repair...",
"I am all ears, ",
".",
"I've heard that guy over there owes you some money.",
"What can you tell me about ",
"Teodoro Fernandez",
"Teodoro Fernandez",
"?",
"Rumor has it some rare goods have arrived in the city recently...",
"I'd like to get your opinion of a certain gentleman by the name of ",
"Baldewyn Coffier",
"Baldewyn Coffier",
".",
"I tried to speak with that gentleman you pointed out, but he refused.",
"I'm looking for a person named ",
"Amiel Berangere",
"Amiel Berangere",
". He is the captain of the brig 'Le Requin'",
"I'm told you've started a war with the English.",
"I am looking for a man by the name of ",
"Raoul Rheims",
"Raoul Rheims",
". Have you seen him?",
"What's the gossip here?",
"I need some work. Don't you know any rich boy on this island who is afraid to travel alone?",
"Thanks. I must go now.",
"If there is such a person, he might prefer to avoid attracting attention with so many consorts - as I'd expect you to know.", 
"Yes, I forgot. All right, I'll come back later, when I've got fewer ships, ha-ha.",
"I don't want to help you, with all the harm you've done to my country.",
"Just look at this patriot. Well, goodbye.", 
"Your hands are covered in blood. Do you seriously think that somebody will travel in your company?",
"You are right, everybody is afraid of me! Ha-ha!",
"You came just in time. One merchant here was searching to sail in company with just the right companions. You'd better talk to him. Here he is, coming into the tavern.",
"I'll do that.",
"No, there is nobody for the moment. Maybe next time.",
"Hmm. Then I will wait.",
"Everyone knows about it, ",
".",
"You're right. They're talking about it all across the archipelago, but that's not what I'm getting at.",
"So what are you getting at?",
"I'm looking for work. I've got my own ship and several strong men who've gone through fire and water with me.",
"I'm afraid you won't have much luck, ",
". Our governor doesn't want your sort taking part in this conflict.",
"My sort? Is he always so picky? ",
"Not picky, no. He's just worried about treason. The only exception is ",
"Amiel Berangere",
" ",
"Amiel Berangere",
", and that's because he's a pure-blooded Frenchman. In fact, his mission is very important: he is to deliver ammunition and weapons to our fleet that captured #sOxbay#!",
"Well, it does look like I'll have trouble finding work, unless... maybe this ",
"Amiel Berangere",
" would put in a good word for me. Do you know where I might find him?",
"It's the first time I've heard about him.",
"That's a pity. Well, let's talk about something else.",
"That is a tragedy, ",
". The point is, he was a successful trader on this island, until he fell into a trap set by ",
"Arnaud Matton",
", the present owner of the store. He was brought to ruin.",
"He's an honest man, isn't he? Is his situation really so desperate that he can't pay off the debt?",
"Alas, ",
", his financial situation is truly dismal. He has a wife and two kids to feed. ",
"Baldewyn Coffier",
" works as hard as he can, but no one has been willing to help him since his business went keel-up.",
"Thanks for the information.",
"So that's what you're getting at! You were hired by ",
"Arnaud Matton",
", to completely ruin this honest man?!",
"Easy now. I just want to understand what's going on here.",
"You're right. And believe me when I say it'll bring me great pleasure to do so.",
"Understand? I know what your 'understand' really means... All right, fine. He really doesn't have any money, and he needs to support his wife and two kids...",
"Thanks for your help.",
"You know, ",
", I've seen a lot of scoundrels in my life, but you... This conversation is over, #ssir#. Good day!",
"I'll remember you said that.",
"To get to the store, you'll want to turn right on leaving the tavern and head through the gates. You'll see it straight away...",
"Thanks. I've got a couple more questions for you...",
"Thanks, that's all I wanted to know.",
"Then you'll be needing the shipyard. It's across from my tavern, just to your left as you leave.",
"Thanks. I've got a couple more questions for you...",
"Thanks, that's all I wanted to know.",
"Never heard that name before.",
"Too bad. Sorry to bother you.",
"Here's a shiny gold piece. I've heard these things work wonders on one's memory...",
"You may be right. What did you say he looked like?",
"A Spaniard with a scar on his face.",
"That hardly narrows it down. But now that you mention it, there was a strange fellow in here about four days ago, might be who you're looking for. But he called himself Jeronimo Elcano.",
"Interesting! What was he doing here?",
"He rented a room, spent a night, and left.",
"He left? Did he speak to anyone?",
"Actually, he did. I saw him talking with a local fellow named ",
"Lucien Bescanceny",
"Lucien Bescanceny",
". They conversed in whispers for a little bit and then parted company.",
"Where does this ",
"Lucien Bescanceny",
"Lucien Bescanceny",
" live?",
"I wouldn't advise you to deal with him, ",
", he's a dangerous man.",
"Relax. I just want to know where he lives.",
"All right, but it's your funeral, perhaps literally, if you're not careful. If you still want to see him leave the tavern and go to the right until you reach the gates to another part of town\nGo through that part of town and look for him in one of the huts there.",
"Thanks, I believe I'll go and pay him a visit.",
"I've got some more questions.",
"Hello, ",
", long time no see. How are you doing?",
"Fine, fine. Mind if I ask you a couple of questions?",
"None of your business. I'll ask the questions.",
"I'm looking to add some sailors to my crew.",
"Just point me to the nastiest rabble looking for work. I need a couple of cutthroats for my ship.",
"Do you have a room for me? I'd like to stay here.",
"Do you have a room free in this pit?",
"You know my rule - you don't order, you don't ask questions.",
"No, I don't like the sound of that, I won't pay.",
"Here's your money.",
"Is it contraband? It's the talk of the town, but the chief of the port is doing nothing about it.",
"I think you know what I'm talking about...",
"What is this conversation for, ",
"?",
"I need to lay my hands on some of that stuff, but I don't know who to contact. I thought, maybe you could help me out.",
"Keep it down, for pity's sake! You see that Portuguese sitting at the table there? I suppose he can help you.",
"Thanks, you've been a great help.",
"What are you talking about?! I don't have anything to do with it!",
"Too bad. I'll have to look somewhere else.",
"I'm sorry, ",
", but I can't help you anymore. Try the workers in the port.",
"Thanks, I give it a shot.",
"Yes, he actually owes some money. 500 gold.",
"I see. I was just wondering. Good-bye.",
"I want to pay off his debt.",
"I don't see why, ",
", he's not a very good man.",
"Perhaps you're right. I'll take your advice.",
"I like him. Crude, but I'm used to that. I'll pay his debt.",
"Not at all! Always glad to help you.",
"Farewell!",
"Suit yourself, but don't say I didn't warn you. He owes me 500 gold.",
"Yes, well, you may be right. Never mind.",
"Here is your money.",
"Very well. And here is his I.O.U. It's yours to do with as you will.",
"Goodbye!",
"Someone named ",
"Amiel Berangere",
"Amiel Berangere",
" rented a room from me. To tell you the truth, I don't know if he is a captain, but he's got the manners of an officer.",
"Perfect! Where can I find him?",
"He went upstairs. I don't think he's left his room since.",
"Thank you.",
"Merciful Heaven! You killed him!",
"I had no choice. He wouldn't listen to reason.",
"Yes... I am sorry for that.",
"What happened here? Why did you kill him?!",
"He contradicted me. I don't care for that. Any more questions?",
"What do we do now? ",
", What am I do to with him?",
"I don't care.",
"Think a moment. There's always a solution.",
"I've got nothing to do with it, ",
", it was you who killed him! I can just call for the guards!",
"Look at this paper that I found on his body. Do you know what it is?",
"That would be a mistake. A fatal mistake.",
"Calm down. We'll come up with something.",
"You'd best come up with some gold. I'll need it to pay the porters to get rid of this man and keep quiet about it!",
"Blackmailer!",
"You can deal with it as you like, but I'm not giving you any money.",
"You pirate! How dare you threaten me?!",
"You've been living far too long in this world.",
"All right, fine. How much gold will it take?",
"Since I'm solving your problem for you, I'll need no less than ",
" gold.",
"I think it'll be easier if I just cut your throat.",
"Here's your gold! But I won't forget this!",
"Wait! I'll take care of this, just keep that blade sheathed!",
"Watch your tongue! Remember who you're speaking to!",
"I'm sorry, ",
". It's just that I don't deal with this sort of thing every day.",
"So, are we square?",
"Yes, yes, ",
", of course. You can leave and rest assured I'll handle this mess.",
"Then I'll see you soon, ",
".",
"Wonderful. But just next time you take it into your head to kill one of my guests, let me know about it beforehand.",
"Don't worry. You'll know. Especially if you're next.",
"Haha, ",
" that's a joke, right? Right?",
"I'll be seeing you, innkeeper. In the meantime, try and decide if I look like a joker.",
"Hmm... even if I know, I'll need money to clean this up.",
"Tell about this paper, and I'll pay you as much as you need.",
"Now we're doing business! This paper is an order to the chief of the port to let you and the ship you're escorting leave. It looks like poor ",
"Amiel Berangere",
" was going to give it to the chief ",
"Turpin Cabanel",
" before setting sail.",
"Hmm, I see. Thank you. Farewell!",
"Look, just think about how to get rid of this mess. How much it will cost?",
"Hey! What about some money? I told you everything...",
"Breathe one more word about money, and I'll shove it back down your throat!",
"Just think about how to fix this. How much it will cost?",
"What are you talking about? Everyone's at home. It's the middle of the night. If I were you, I'd wait 'til morning. Maybe you'd like to rent a room?",
"Do you have a free room?",
"No, let's talk about something else.",
"Sorry, captain. I've got nothing for you. Captain ",
"Amiel Berangere",
" is due to set sail tomorrow, but until then I can't get him out of his room.",
"Who is this ",
"Amiel Berangere",
"?",
"And where is he going?",
"Until recently he was in command of a local trader's ship. Then he bought his own ship, and now he works for himself. Probably transporting contraband, otherwise where would he get the money? \nHe's not doing very well lately, though. He has to make do with any job he can find.",
"By the way, what kind of job can a captain find on #sisland_Falaise de Fleur#?",
"I don't know for sure, but I've heard that he was hired ",
" by the Governor to escort a war-bark full of supplies to #sOxbay#. You must already know we are at war with your compatriots.",
"I see.... Well, where can I spend a night then?",
"Oh, all kinds of work: carrying cargoes, special deliveries, chasing after pirates. And ",
"Amiel Berangere",
" was hired to escort a warship.",
"Hmm.... What kind of ship?",
"It looked like a supply ship. They're likely delivering food to the French fleet. It's war, you know, so they hired him to be certain it didn't end up at the bottom of the sea. It may also be carrying gunpowder or bombs.",
"I see... So, where can I spend a night?",
"I don't know. Perhaps you could talk with him. He doesn't look like a bad guy. Maybe he'd be willing to share the room with you.",
"Hmm.... I hope it has two beds.",
"Stop this outrage, at once, or I'll have to call the guards!",
"All right, all right! I'm leaving!",
"But while you're solving problems",
"why don't you talk to poor Patric the street merchant? He's right outside the door and in terrible states...",
"Could you tell me if someone from 'La Fougueuse' is in your tavern?",
"No, and this would be impossible.",
"Why?",
"Since yesterday, the crew is confined to the ship and can't be in the town. I know the ship must weigh anchor the day after tomorrow.",
"Do you also know her destination?",
"No. Even the few crewmembers I met in the first days of their stay didn't know their mission. I guess only the captain and our governor know it.",
"Yes of course, the Governor should have received communications from France with the ship, have they met yet?",
"Shortly after their arrival, the Governor had a formal dinner with captain of 'La Fougueuse', they ordered the best wine from me.",
"Aurelien Bergerat is the name of that captain, right?",
"Indeed, a brilliant officer from what I've heard... By the way, why so many questions about that ship?",
"I wanted work on this fine French ship, she will take many a handsome prize ship and information always helps get a better position... But it seems to be too late. Thank you for your help.",
