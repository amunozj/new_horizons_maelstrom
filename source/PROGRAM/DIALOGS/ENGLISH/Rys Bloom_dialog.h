"Hello, ",
". Unfortunately, I've not had the honor of meeting you before, but I can tell you're the captain of that ship down in the harbor.",
"So what? I don't have time for chatting with sailors.",
"I'm ",
". What ship are you talking about exactly?",
"The '",
"'. She's yours, isn't she, ",
"?",
"How'd you guess?",
"That may indeed be my ship. But it's really none of your business. Be gone.",
"It wasn't difficult, ",
". I saw you coming ashore. I'm ",
".",
"I see. Well, it was nice speaking with you.",
"Don't you have something more interesting to do then watch ships sail in and out of the harbor?",
"Unfortunately, I've been relieved of duties for breaching ship's rules.",
"That's too bad. Can't you do something about it?",
"That's unfortunate. Well, good luck and good day!",
"Well... maybe if a respected captain were put in a word for me to the harbor master... aw, but who cares about me ",
"?",
"Hmm... I'll try to do something about it.",
"I could talk to the harbor master, but I would need something from you in order to do that.",
"Sorry, I can't help you.",
"Really, ",
"?! Well, captain, if you can help me I promise that I won't forget it.",
"Come on, that's not what I'm after.",
"Well, actually, I don't have time to help you.",
"Oh. So, your generosity has a price when it comes to your fellow man, ",
". I do have something to offer though.",
"Well, let's hear it then ",
"Unlikely. I don't think so.",
"Hey, no, captain. You're going to help me and I'll return the favor, that's how I am!",
"Let me first talk to the harbormaster.",
"By the way, where can I find the harbormaster?",
"Well then, there is not much for me to do except for just watching ships go in and out of the harbor. Farewell, captain!",
"Goodbye.",
"I know someone who'll pay very good money to anyone who can spare him certain chores. \nIf you help me I'll introduce you to him. He trusts me and I'm sure you'll suit him perfectly.",
"Hmm...that's kind of interesting. All right, I'll try to help you.",
"By the way, where can I find the harbormaster?",
"Perhaps he's in that building in front of the city's gates ",
"Aha, thank you.",
"Oh, ",
"! Hello, ",
".",
"Hello, ",
". I thought we'd never meet again...",
"Oh, it's you again, ",
". I'm glad to see you safe and sound.",
"So, no one decided to help you, ",
"?",
"Hello. And goodbye! I'm busy.",
"Exactly, ",
". I'll have to bid the sea farewell.",
"All right, I'll help you.",
"What's in it for me?",
"It's no one's fault but your own. Farewell.",
"Really, ",
"?! Well, captain, if you can help me I promise that I won't forget it.",
"Come on, that's not what I'm after.",
"Well, actually, I don't have time to help you.",
"Oh. So, your generosity has a price when it comes to your fellow man, ",

"Well, let's hear it then",
"Unlikely. I don't think so.",

"Let me first talk to the harbormaster.",
"By the way, where can I find the harbormaster?",
"Well then, there is not much for me to do except for just watching ships in and out of the harbor. Farewell, captain!",
"Good-bye.",
"I know someone who'll pay very good money to anyone who can spare him certain chores. \nIf you help me I'll introduce you to him. He trusts me and I'm sure you'll suit him perfectly.",
"Hmm...that's kind of interesting. All right, I'll try to help you.",
"By the way, where can I find the harbormaster?",
"Hey, it's ",
"! Hello, ",
".",
"Hello, ",
". I never thought that we'd meet again some day...",
"Oh, it's you, ",
". I'm glad to see you safe and sound.",
" Did you have any success?",
"I'm going to the harbor master now.",
"Not yet. I'm sorry, let's talk later.",
"By the way, where can I find the harbormaster?",
"Oh, I'm sorry, I don't mean to rush you, ",
". I'm just so tired of being here on land!",
"You are not going to be here for long. I'll take care of it.",
"Listen, I've got a couple of questions for you. You're an experienced sailor, aren't you?",
"I'd like to ask you about navigation.",
"I hope so, ",
". I'd love to buy you a drink, but you're a captain and I'm just a sailor.",
"Ha! Offer me that before putting out to sea.",
"But a sailor can drink with a captain!",
"You'll be hard pressed to find better sailor then me between here and #sisland_Redmond#, ",
"!",
"Then share your experience with me.",
"Hmm, well, all right, I'll see you later.",
"I can hardly give you advice about navigation or maneuvering since I'm not an officer. \n But as to some other things – I'll be glad to help you.",
"Perfect. What can you tell me about what captain should know?",
"How should I treat my crew?",
"How about a couple of seafaring tips?",
"Hmm, I'll can't tell you about navigation or commerce but some things are vital for us sailors. That's why we need to learn them ourselves in order not to get caught with our pants down!",
"What do you mean?",
"First and the most important is a defence. If a captain can't properly arrange his crew on a ship,\nthen heavy fire will cover the deck with blood\nThe better defence, the fewer the casualties.",
"Continue, I'm listening to you..",
"I see, thank you for clearing it up for me.",
"Never neglect your crew, unless you've got an itching to run aground or be adrift. A crew is the heart of a ship, and captain won't be able to run his ship alone. \n If you don't have enough people in your team then the ship will be as awkward as a cachalot.",
"Sailors are people too. No one doubts that.",
"I think I'll give you some sage advice for young captains, who often run headlong into battle and can get caught by overwhelming numbers.\nWhen you are trying to escape, remember, it's better to loose your cargo then your head.",
"I see. Anything else?",
"Farewell, thank you for your advice.",
"Next thing you need to know is a bit of swordplay. Some say only a captain should know how to do that, but sailors have a bit of knowin' about it too.",
"Great! I like the sound of that.",
"I guess that's enough information for me for today. Farewell.",
"Morale is very important for your crew too. If the crew is not happy with their captain, mutiny is not far behind.",
"Let's change the subject.",
"Thank you, we'll talk about it some other time. Goodbye.",
"I say, ",
". Never fight with the city's guards. They never fight fair. \n They'll attack you all at once and just tie you hand and foot. It's better to fight with 3 pirates then a bunch of guards.",
"Let's change the subject.",
"Thank you, we'll talk about it some other time. Goodbye.",
"One more important thing is how to board your enemy. Your crew needs to learn how to throw grapples and rope\nonto a ship you want to board. They'll need to be able to do at varying speeds and distances.",
"That's funny, when you are giving advice you don't.",
"Thank you, we'll talk about it some other time. Goodbye.",
"I'm sorry, ",
". I was carried away by the moment.",
"All right. Let's change the subject.",
"Well, thanks for the information. Goodbye.",
"Ah, ",
"! Hello, ",
".",
"Hello, ",
". I didn't think we'd meet again...",
"Ah, it's you again, ",
". I'm glad to see you safe and sound.",
" Are there any results?",
"Alas, ",
". I didn't manage to do anything.",
"Not yet, I'm sorry, let's talk later.",
"That's too bad, but anyway, thanks for your help,",
".",
"Don't be upset, ",
". I'll take you to my ship.",
"Listen, I've got a couple of questions for you. You are an experienced sailor, aren't you?",
"I'd like to ask you about seafaring.",
"Well, how am I doing, captain?",
"You can buy me a drink, Rys.",
"I haven't solved this problem yet.",
"Is it really so bad, ",
"?",
"I guess no, on the contrary, you can become employed to a ship...",
"Oh, thank you, captain! To tell the truth in my heart of hearts I didn't believe that you'll be able to do that!",
"Hmm, you underestimated my talents.",
"Good luck, ",
"! I'll see you.",
"I admit that I did… So, what can I do for you, ",
"? Let me show you my gratitude.",
"Thank you, ",
", but I don't need anything. Farewell.",
"By the way, I thought - maybe you will join my crew as my officer?",
"Well I guess one more lecture wouldn't hurt.",
"It's perfect for me.",
"! I need some amount of money to finish my business here.",
"How much do you need.",
"500 gold. I understand that's it a lot of money.",
"Deal, here is the money.",
"Really, it's a big sum. I can't afford that right now.", // PB: Changed to save confusion
", captain. It's good to see you and good that you are still alive. It's dangerous to be a captain these days.",
"Listen, ",
", could you please tell me about what makes a good captain once again?",
"By the way, I thought - maybe you will join my crew as my officer?",
"Well, I think I know that. Goodbye.",
"What will be the orders, captain.",
"None.",
