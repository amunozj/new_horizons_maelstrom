"Hello Captain! Nice to meet you.",
"Hello Miss Swann. Excuse me to tell you but it seems that I've already heard your name.",
"Maybe you met my father, Weatherby Swann, in the past. He was Governor of #sRedmond# before the arrival of Lord Cutler Beckett.",
"and what does a Governor's daughter do at #sTortuga#?",
"Will and I have had to run off #sisland_Redmond# so as not to be arrested by Lord Beckett. He unfairly accused us and my father of treason.",
"Ok, I understand.",
"Captain, it would be better to not waste more time. You can go to your ship. We'll join you.",
"Very well.",
"Now, we know that the island is not deserted.",
"Yes and it seems to be dangerous. We have to be on one's guard. Let's keep going our walk.",
"The port seems to be calm. Even the Spanish fleut has no crew at the moment.",
"Really strange... The only thing we are sure is the silver train didn't arrive...",
"The silver is loaded, Captain.",
"Great! Let's sail for #sTortuga#. We have business to do there.",
"Captain, I was happy to work with you. Maybe we'll meet you again...",
"Maybe. Goodbye Miss Swann.",
"Godless pirate Barbossa!",
"That's the second time I've watched that man take my ship.",
"You were marooned here once before. We can escape in the same way.",
"To what point and purpose, young missy? The #scursed_ship# is gone. Unless you have a lot of sails hidden in that bodice - unlikely - young Turner will be dead long before you can reach him.",
"But, you're Captain ",
"And what?",
"Very well, instead of squabbling we should explore this small island, right?",
"As you like! Now, we have the time.",
"That was a hard fight!",
"Indeed. How did you come here? I thought you would stay aboard the Dauntless?",
"I ran away just after you left the ship. I couldn't leave Will alone.",
"Thank you for rescuing me. My father will be as grateful as I am.",
"Your necklace, it is such an unusual design. Where did you get it?",
"Oh! I... er... picked it up somewhere, I don't remember.",
"Interesting...",
"As is my place with Will.",
"[Will] Oh! ... Elizabeth...(sigh!)",
"Oh! ... Will... (sigh!)",
"Oh, get a room!",
"Well... I've managed to be of some help at least. I made a bonfire on the other side of the island, with the rum you had, and the smoke from that will attract the English Fleet.",
"WHAT! MY RUM! What are you doing woman! We must get over there, fast!", 
"James Norrington. What has the world done to you?!", 
"Elizabeth?! Mister Gibbs, hide the rum ... Come to join me crew, lass? Welcome aboard.",
"I'm here to find the man I love.. Meaning William Turner, Captain Sparrow.",
"That's nice and all but let us move this conversation to somewhere more private...like me ship, oh, and bring him as well...[Looks at James Norrington on the floor]",
"Jack, I still need answers.",
"You know, these clothes do not flatter you at all. It should be a dress or nothing.",
"I know Will came to find you. Where is he?.",
"Darling, I am truly unhappy to have to tell you this but... through an unfortunate and *entirely* unforeseeable series of circumstances that have nothing whatsoever to do with me, poor William has been press-ganged into Davy Jones' crew...",
"Jack. All I want is to find Will.",
"Are you certain? Is that what you really want most?",
"Of course.",
"Because I would think, you'd want to find a way to *save* Will the most.",
"And you have a way of doing that?",
"Well, there is a chest... A chest of unknown size and origin. Which contains the still-beating heart o' Davy Jones.  And whoever possesses that chest possesses the leverage to command Jones to do whatever it is he or she wants, including... saving brave William from his grim fate.",
"How do we find it?",
"With this. My Compass... is unique.",
"Unique here having the meaning of broken ?",
"True enough. This Compass does not point north.",
"Where does it point?",
"It points to the thing you want most in this world.",
"Oh Jack! Are you telling the truth?",
"Every word, love. And what you want most in this world is to find the chest of Davy Jones, is it not?",
"To save Will?",
"By finding the chest of Davy Jones.",
