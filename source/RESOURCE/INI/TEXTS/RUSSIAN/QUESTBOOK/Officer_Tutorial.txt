title=Tutorial - The Old Captain's Advice
text.t1=I met an officer in a tavern and when I tried to hire him an old captain approached me. He told me officers aren't what they used to be. Nowadays all officers are specilized in different aspects. He offered to learn me more about these different types of officers. I should go to #sOranjestad# and meet him there before 3 months have passed.
text.t2=For now the captain can't teach me anything. I should try this again after a new update.
