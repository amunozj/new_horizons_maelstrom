I tell you friend, piracy is a menace. They don't just steal your goods now, they steal your ship and sell their prisoners into slavery! If they don't kill them all first, of course. Why, I've heard they even use their prisoners for wagers! Gambling and piracy will be the death of our society, I tell you! Uh... you're not a pirate, are you?{I tell you friend, piracy is a menace.

Our governor is a fine gentleman, sir. Do you know he's already had three officials sent to prison for corruption?

We live in a lawless age, captain. The jungles are swarming with villains, the seas are rife with pirates... What's an honest merchant to do? Hire an escort, I guess... And many are.

Oh, lord! Will our governor not do something about those gutless savages in the jungle whose only pastime is chasing down poor girls and having their way with them, and robbing travelers blind?!

Have you heard about the latest form of pirate? This one walks on land, you see: he's called a loanshark, and he's worse than a leech.

An old sailor told me he is considering retiring. The weather gets quite nasty in the colder months, storms and such.
