title=Side Quest - Elizabeth Shaw's Disappearance
text.t1=The governor of #sGrand Cayman# on #sisland_Cayman# Island asked me to search for his missing daughter and the frigate 'Lightning' that was sent to search for her and subsequently went missing as well. This mission sounds like easy money; the governor worries too much. Most likely the convoy got caught up in a storm and the frigate is still searching. The ships set sail from #sisland_Antigua#, so that is where I will begin my search. Surely port admiral Lord Barham will confirm my opinion.
text.t2=The governor of #sGrand Cayman# on #sisland_Cayman# Island asked me to search for his missing daughter and the frigate 'Lightning' that was sent to search for her and subsequently went missing as well. I declined to take on this mission. It sounds like too much trouble to me. I have no intention to chase a governor's daughter all over the Caribbean.
text.t3=Perhaps I was too quick to judge the governor as worrying too much. One pirate ship capable of sinking an entire convoy indeed is quite worrisome. The frigate 'Lightning' set sail for #sPhilipsburg# on #sisland_Saint Martin#. If I am lucky I'll be able to catch up with her so that we can continue the search together. Two ships against that mystery pirate ship is better odds than one.
text.t4=The governor's account didn't really help much. The ship never arrived here. I am not leaving just yet though. Perhaps the innkeeper knows something the governor doesn't. It wouldn't be the first time I'd acquire the most valuable information in the tavern.
text.t5=I was right to visit the tavern. A fisherman saw a ship being dragged to the bottom of the sea by a monster. Something really weird is going on. I had better visit Baie d'Orient to find some more clues.
text.t6=When I arrived at Baie d'Orient, I found the corpse of an English soldier with some debris and a small chest next to him. The chest contained documents confirming that the sunk ship indeed was the 'Lightning'. It seems I have hit a dead end. I don't know where to go next. Perhaps I should pay a visit to the old admiral Octave Fabre. He lives at the naval academy of #sPointe a Pitre# on #sisland_Guadeloupe#. He knows a lot about the sea and its more mysterious aspects.
text.t7=I was thinking to come back to #sisland_Cayman# Island to provide Governor Shaw with the collected information when two pirates of the Davy Jones’ crew approached me to take me to their captain. After an hour of walking, we reached a small creek where the Flying Dutchman, the Davy Jones’ ship, was moored. By a stratagem, I succeeded in releasing Elizabeth Shaw. Now, I just have to bring her back to #sGrand Cayman#.
text.t8=Just my luck! Arrived at #sisland_Cayman# Island, the Flying Dutchman was waiting for me. Davy Jones is smarter than I thought. Nevertheless,  I succeeded in mooring my ship and left Elizabeth at the town hall. After talking to Davy Jones on the shore, he thoughtlessly wounded me in the head. I rested some hours in the tavern room. When I woke up, Elizabeth confirmed me the leaving of Davy Jones and executing her advice, I fetched the reward. From now on, I know that a pirate not like the others lives in this archipelago.
text.t9=I do not see the frigate in port. I will pay a visit to the honourable governor of #sPhilipsburg# to find out if she recently made port here.
text.t10=I will visit the #sisland_Antigua# Port Admiral again.
text.t11=Now what? I'm in trouble. I should report back to Governor Shaw at #sGrand Cayman#.
