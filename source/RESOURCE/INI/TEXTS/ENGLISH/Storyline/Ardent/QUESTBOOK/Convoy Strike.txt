title=Convoy Strike
text.t1=#sromance# has made a very tempting offer. #svillain# has a convoy due in #sOxbay# soon. In view of what #spronoun1# did to #spronoun2#, I'm to attack that convoy. And #sromance1# wants to come along for the fun!
text.t2=The Governor of #sSantiago# reluctantly agreed. I have a Letter of Reprisal authorising an attack on this convoy because of #svillain#'s crime. But I must not attack any other English ships or my relationship with Spain in general and with #sromance# in particular will probably suffer.
text.t3=The convoy arrived in #sOxbay# with a cargo of silk, which it traded for silver. It then sailed for #sCartagena#.
text.t4=The girl working at #sCartagena# hotel, after being bribed with a bottle, told me the convoy picked up a load of gold and sailed for #sisland_Curacao# before continuing on to #sisland_Redmond#. So #sisland_Curacao# is our last chance to catch it.
text.t5=We've taken over the #sship#, one of the ships of the convoy. We need to hire a full crew for her. Meanwhile, #sofficer# will take our own ship to #sSantiago#.
text.t6=The convoy is ours! The ships are loaded with coffee, which should fetch a fine price. And I've found the money the convoy commander made from trades on the way to #sWillemstad#. Now, back to #sSantiago# with the prizes and the good news.
text.t7=I had to hand one of the ships over to the governor. Fair enough, we did use his name to trick the governor of #sWillemstad# into helping. Anyway, the other ships provided plenty of reward. And now I'm reunited with my own ship.
text.t8=Well played! #sromance# now has command of a ship, even if only for a short time. We're to take the #sship# to #sWillemstad# and give it to the governor as thanks for his assistance. #sromance# will also hand over a letter proposing a trade deal between #sSantiago# and #sWillemstad#.
text.t9=And now back to #sSantiago# with the good news - the governor of #sWillemstad# has agreed to the trade deal.
text.t10=Smiles all round. The governor of #sWillemstad# has a new ship. Governor #sfatherinlaw# has his trade deal. And I have #sromance# back. We're making quite a team!
text.t11=#sromance# has been killed. I will continue with the mission to attack the convoy anyway, but even if I succeed, victory will not be as sweet now. And #sgovernor# will not be at all happy about this.
text.t12=That didn't go well. The governor didn't fall for my ploy. I can't help wondering how it would have gone if #sromance# had been there. Now my only hope is to catch the convoy as it approaches #sisland_Redmond#.
text.t13=Revenge is mine! The ships are loaded with coffee, which should fetch a fine price. And I've found the money the convoy commander made from trades on the way to #sWillemstad#. But I'm not looking forward to reporting #sromance#'s death to Governor #sgovernor#. Perhaps I'll just avoid seeing him in future.
text.t14=Governor #sgovernor# was surprisingly forgiving. He thinks #sromance# would not have wanted him to punish me, and honours that. Still, I'm not exactly welcome any more.
text.t15=I've arrived at #sisland_Curacao#. The convoy is in port. I wonder if I can persuade the governor to help me board one of the ships...
text.t16=All in all, not a bad bit of work. The governor of #sWillemstad# has a new ship. Governor #sfatherinlaw# has his trade deal. And #sromance# is safely back home.
text.t17=We've taken over the #sship#, one of the ships of the convoy. We need to hire a full crew for her.
text.t18=The convoy is ours! The ships are loaded with coffee, which should fetch a fine price. And I've found the money the convoy commander made from trades on the way to #sWillemstad#. Now to find a good place to sell all that coffee.
text.t19=#sromance# has been killed. I will continue with the mission to attack the convoy anyway, but even if I succeed, victory will not be as sweet now.
text.t20=The convoy is mine! It's a shame #sromance# isn't here to see it. Still, all that coffee should fetch me a fine price somewhere.
text.t21=I have received a Letter of Marque from Spain, which makes me a privateer. And a Letter of Reprisal authorising the attack on #svillain#'s convoy, otherwise it would breach the terms of the Letter of Marque. I can't help feeling as though Governor #sgovernor# has put me on a leash. But it was either that or he would put me on a hangman's noose.
text.t22=Revenge is mine! The ships are loaded with coffee, which should fetch a fine price. And I've found the money the convoy commander made from trades on the way to #sWillemstad#. But I'm not looking forward to reporting back to Governor #sgovernor#. Perhaps I'll just avoid seeing him in future.
text.t23=I had to hand one of the ships over to the governor. Fair enough, we did use his name to trick the governor of #sWillemstad# into helping. Anyway, the other ships provided plenty of reward.
