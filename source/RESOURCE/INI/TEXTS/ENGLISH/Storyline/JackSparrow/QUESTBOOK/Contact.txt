title=Justine Le Moigne's Disappearance
text.t1=The governor of #sFalaise de fleur# on #sisland_Falaise de fleur# asked me to search for his missing daughter and the frigate 'La Foudre' that was sent to search for her and subsequently went missing as well. This mission sounds like easy money; the governor worries too much. Most likely the convoy got caught up in a storm and the frigate is still searching. The ships set sail from #sHavana# on #sisland_Cuba#, so that is where I will begin my search. Surely Port Admiral Talicerdor will confirm my opinion.
text.t2=The governor of #sFalaise de fleur# on #sisland_Falaise de fleur# asked me to search for his missing daughter and the frigate 'La Foudre' that was sent to search for her and subsequently went missing as well. I declined to take on this mission. It sounds like too much trouble to me. I have no intention to chase a governor's daughter all over the Caribbean.
text.t3=Everybody seems to be going crazy now, the #sHavana# Port Admiral told me how a single pirate ship was seen after a storm and sunk the entire convoy. The frigate 'La Foudre' set sail for #sMarigot# on #sisland_Saint Martin#. If I am lucky I'll be able to catch up with her so that we can continue the search together. I still don't think we have anything to worry about.
text.t4=The governor of #sPhilipsburg#'s account didn't really help much. The ship never arrived at #sisland_Saint Martin#. I am not leaving just yet though. Perhaps the innkeeper knows something the governor doesn't.
text.t5=I was right to visit the tavern. A fisherman saw a ship being dragged to the bottom of the sea by a monster. Something really weird is going on (could this all be some crazy dream??). I had better visit Baie d'Orient to find some more clues.
text.t6=When I arrived at Baie d'Orient, I found the corpse of a French soldier with some debris and a small chest next to him. The chest contained documents confirming that the sunk ship indeed was 'La Foudre'. It seems I have hit a dead end. I don't know where to go next. Perhaps I should pay a visit to the pirate settlement on #sisland_Turks#. I hear they have a libary with all sorts of books, maybe I can find one about the sea and its more mysterious aspects. Or maybe I should just pinch myself and wake up.
text.t7=I was thinking to come back to #sisland_Falaise de Fleur# to provide Governor Le Moigne with the collected information when the Flying Dutchman, Davy Jones’ ship (I can't believe any man could look like that, let alone the whole crew), came out of nowhere. He boarded my ship and by a game of luck, I succeeded in releasing Justine Le Moigne. Now, I just have to bring her back to #sisland_Falaise de Fleur#.
text.t8=Just my luck! Arrived at #sisland_Falaise de Fleur#, the Flying Dutchman was waiting for me. Davy Jones is smarter than I thought, obviously he wasn't tricked into becoming what he now is. Nevertheless,  I succeeded in mooring my ship and left Justine at the town hall. After talking to Davy Jones on the shore, he thoughtlessly wounded me in the head. I rested some hours in the tavern room. When I woke up, Justine confirmed me the leaving of Davy Jones and executing her advice, I fetched the reward. From now on, I know that a pirate not like the others lives in this archipelago.
text.t9=On arriving in #sisland_Saint Martin# I do not see the frigate in port. I will pay a visit to the honourable governor of #sMarigot# to find out if she recently made port here.
text.t10=On leaving #sGrand Turk# town I was suddenly approached by two... Well creatures, maybe the story about Davy Jones is real... I will visit the #sHavana#'s Portadmiral on #sisland_Cuba# again and see if he will help me.
text.t11=Now what? I'm in trouble. I might need to sail away from #sisland_Cuba#.
text.t12=Davy Jones caught up with me again! Luckily for me Captain Maggee told me to take Tia Dalma with me when I sailed out. She stepped in and sailed away with Davy Jones, it was almost like Jones listened to everything Tia Dalma said. In any case I shouldn't have to worry about Jones again. There are some weird things in this world.
text.t13=The governor of #sMarigot# said that he never saw the ship in port and that the captain never contacted him, or Miss Le Moigne for that matter. Perhaps I should try the tavern.
text.t14=No luck at the tavern either, the #sHavana# Port Admiral seemed sure this was where the ship was headed, maybe I should sail across island to #sPhilipsburg# and ask their governer if he has seen/sunk the ship.
text.t15=Davy Jones caught up with me again! Luckily for me Captain Maggee told me to take Tia Dalma with me when I sailed out. She stepped in and told Davy Jones it wasn't my time yet, it was almost like Jones listened to everything Tia Dalma said. In any case I shouldn't have to worry about Jones for a little while thanks to Tia Dalma. There are some weird things in this world.
