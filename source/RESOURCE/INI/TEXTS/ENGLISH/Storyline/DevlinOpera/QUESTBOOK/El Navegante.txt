title=El Navegante
text.t1=Well, of course Blaze lost his piece of the map in a game of cards... To the navigator of the Spanish treasure ship 'Villa de Malaga', which he last saw in #sGreenford# on #sisland_Oxbay#. It's best to start our search there.
text.t2=No luck! The 'Villa de Malaga' has already left #sGreenford#!
text.t3=A man walked into a bar... I think I know him! Anyway, he luckily could inform me that the 'Villa de Malaga' is in #sSantiago# for repairs.
text.t4=We've reached #sisland_Cuba#, now we should get to the port of #sSantiago# as directly as possible. It's best if I try to avoid any trouble with the Spanish though.
text.t5=The navigator must be in the tavern!
text.t6=I need to find and round up five sailors from the 'Villa de Malaga'. Seems easy enough!
text.t7=I'm looking for the drunkard Juan, the god-fearing Jorge, the adventurous Ricardo, the ladies' man Pedro and the ship's carpenter Paolo.
text.t8=I must pour some water over drunk and sleepy Juan! Perhaps I find a bucket at a nearby market stall. And there's plenty of water in the sea...
text.t9=Juan has returned to the ship!
text.t10=I need some paper so this madman can draw his picture! No matter how late it is, I have to try my luck at the local store...
text.t11=Paolo has returned to the ship!
text.t12=Pedro has returned to the ship!
text.t13=Jorge has left his bible in the tavern and he won't leave town without it!
text.t14=Jorge has returned to the ship!
text.t15=This idiot has locked himself out of the town gate! There are no guards here, but the officer on duty must have a key. I assume he's patrolling the town.
text.t16=Ricardo has returned to the ship!
text.t17=Everyone is back at the ship!
text.t18=I must find a safe way for Balboa to return to his ship, while he is hiding in the shipyard. A few crewmen are only waiting to catch him drunk!
text.t19=The coast is clear! I can send Balboa to the ship now.
text.t20=With this comfy cloak, Balboa can safely sneak to the ship!
