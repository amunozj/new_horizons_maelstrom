title=My Life as a Waitress
text.t1=I need to help Marcel Jauri waiting the tables by taking drink orders and choosing the right beverages. The patrons will only give hints and clues about each other.
text.t2=I must only ever choose a person's drink when I'm sure about it. I can always come back to any patron, so no pressure.
text.t3=No guessing is required. I can get there through logic and the process of elimination.
text.t4=Only a hat is a hat. Wigs and hoods don't count as hats.
text.t5=If in doubt where to start, I must remember that dead men don't drink.
text.t6=I must go in alone. My friends will have to wait outside.
text.t7=Before I start, SAVE!
